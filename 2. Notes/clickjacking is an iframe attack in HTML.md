[Clickjacking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Clickjacking)Â is one kind of common iframe attack where hackers embed an invisible iframe into your document (or embed your document into their own malicious website) and use it to capture users' interactions. This is a common way to mislead users or steal sensitive data.
