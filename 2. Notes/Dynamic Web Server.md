We call it "dynamic" because 
    **the application server updates the hosted files before** sending content to your browser via the [[HTTP server]].
Webpages in dynamic websites are normally created by inserting data from a database into placeholders in HTML templates


It consists of a static web server + extra software, 
Most commonly an _application server_ and a _database_. 


## Examples where Dynamic Web Server is used:
Imagine how many products are available on Amazon, and imagine how many posts have been written on Facebook? Creating a separate static page for each product or post would be completely impractical.

Dynamic sites can highlight content that is more relevant based on user preferences and habits.
It can also make sites easier to use by storing personal preferences and information
