When data is correctly formated by [[6 - Presentation Layer]] 
Data will be passed through the session layer. 


## Sees if connection w/ other computer across network is possible. 
-> Fail: If **session CAN'T be establised, it sends back an error** and the **==process goes no further==**
-> Success: If **session CANÂ be established** then
**==session layer will maintain the established connection==**, 


It also **co-operate with session layer of remote computer** in **order ==to synchronise communications.**==


## Why session layer is important
**As each session it creates is unique** to the communication in question. 
This allows you to make multiple requests to different endpoints simultaneously without all the data getting mixed up (think about opening two tabs in a web browser at the same time)!
