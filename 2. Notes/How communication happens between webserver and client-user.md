## To access a website

You, the client, give a [[example of HTTP reQUEST by CLIENT|request]] to the webserver  


The webserver will give a [[example of RESPONSE from WEBSERVER|response]] to your computer, 
1. Upon receiving a request, an HTTP server first checks if the requested URL matches an existing file.
2. If so, the web server sends the file content back to the browser. If not, an application server builds the necessary file.
3. If neither process is possible, the web server returns an error message to the browser, most commonly 404 Not Found. The 404 error is so common that some web designers devote considerable time and effort to designing 404 error pages.

If webserver's [[example of RESPONSE from WEBSERVER|response]] is `OK`, 
the, files required to display website will be sent to your computer.
