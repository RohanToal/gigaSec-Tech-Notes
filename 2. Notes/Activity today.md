3. What exactly is an information system? How does it work? What are its management. organization and technology
Information system is the use of technology to spread, process or disseminate information and knowledge. 
The main components of information systems are 
-	computer hardware / software, 
-	telecommunications, 
-	databases 
-	data warehouses, 
-	human resources. 
The hardware, software, and telecommunications constitute information technology (IT), which is now ingrained in the operations and management of organizations. 
Large organizations typically employ distributed computer systems, from powerful parallel-processing servers located in data centres to widely dispersed personal computers and mobile devices, integrated into the organizational information systems. 
Telecommunications are used to connect, or network, computer systems and portable and wearable devices and to transmit information. Connections are established via wired or wireless media. Wired technologies include coaxial cable and fibre optics. Wireless technologies, predominantly based on the transmission of microwaves and radio waves, support mobile computing
A database is a collection of interrelated data organized so that individual records or groups of records can be retrieved to satisfy various criteria. Typical examples of databases include employee records and product catalogs. Databases support the operations and management functions of an enterprise. Data warehouses contain the archival data, collected over time, that can be mined for information in order to develop and market new products, serve the existing customers better, or reach out to potential new customers.
Qualified people are a vital component of any information system. Technical personnel include development and operations managers, business analysts, systems analysts and designers, database administrators, programmers, computer security specialists, and computer operators. In addition, all workers in an organization must be trained to utilize the capabilities of information systems as fully as possible.






3.1 Define an information system and describe the activities it performs
Information system, an integrated set of components for collecting, storing, and processing data and for providing information, knowledge, and digital products.
The activities it performs are the following:
-	Acquiring Information 
-	Managing information systems
-	Security and Control of Data 
Acquiring Information
Information system is a high risk high reward corporate asset therefore, organizations have to plan for the long term when acquiring information systems and services that will support business initiatives. essential applications are identified and project priorities are set. For example, certain projects may have to be carried out immediately to satisfy a new government reporting regulation or to interact with a new customer’s information system. Other projects may be given a higher priority because of their strategic role or greater expected benefits.
With today’s highly developed IT industry, companies tend to acquire information systems and services from specialized vendors. The principal tasks of information systems specialists involve modifying the applications for their employer’s needs and integrating the applications to create a coherent systems architecture for the firm.
Managing information systems
After an installed system is handed over to its users and operations personnel, it will almost invariably be modified extensively over its useful life in a process known as system maintenance. A large system will typically be used and maintained for some 5 to 10 years or even longer. Most maintenance is to adjust the system to the organization’s changing needs and to new equipment and other software, but inevitably some maintenance involves correcting design errors and exterminating software “bugs” as they are discovered. 
Information services of an organization are delivered by an outside firm, by an internal unit, or by a combination of the two. Outsourcing of information services helps with such objectives as cost savings, access to superior personnel, and focusing on core competencies. The specific systems of information ought to be configured into a coherent architecture to deliver the necessary information services. Many organizations rely on outside firms—that is, specialized IT companies—to deliver some, or even all, of their information services.
Security and Control of Data 
Information systems security is responsible for the integrity and safety of system resources and activities. Although instances of computer crime and abuse receive extensive media attention, human error is estimated to cause greater losses in information systems operation. Disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and fires are the particular concern of disaster recovery planning, which is a part of a corporate business continuity plan. A contingency scheme is also necessary to cover the failure of servers, telecommunications networks, or software. 
To continually monitor information systems, intrusion detection systems are used. They detect anomalous events and log the information necessary to produce reports and to establish the source and the nature of the possible intrusion. More active systems also attempt to prevent the intrusion upon detection in real time.


3.2 List and describe the organizational, management. and technology dimensions of information systems
An information system represents a combination of management, organization, and technology elements.

Management‘s job is to make decisions and formulate action plans to solve organizational problems. The management dimension of information systems involves:
-	leadership
-	strategy
-	management behavior. 

Information technology is the tool used by managers to deal with change.
The technology dimensions consist of:
-	computer hardware
-	software 
-	data management technology 
-	networking/telecommunications technology (including the Internet). 

Organizations are formal social units developed to the attainment of specific goals.
The organization dimension of information systems involves: 
-	organization‘s hierarchy
-	functional specialties
-	business processes
-	culture
-	political interest groups.




3.3 Distinguish between data and information and between information systems literacy and computer literacy.
Data is a raw, unorganized collection of facts, while information are in organized format and puts those facts into context. 
Information literacy describes your ability to recognize when you need specific information and then access, evaluate, organise, and use information from a variety of sources.
Computer Literarcy means the level of expertise and familiarity someone has with computers. Computer literacy generally refers to the ability to use applications rather than to program.

3.4 Explain how the Internet and the World Wide Web are related to the other technology components of information systems. 
Let’s define Internet and World Wide Web First
The world wide web is just another way we share data over computers through the usage of the web browsers
However, the internet describes every connection between countless, separate servers, computers, and devices. We use the internet to transfer the information from one computer to another.

The information systems requires the usage of internet and the world wide web as a medium to transfer information.
