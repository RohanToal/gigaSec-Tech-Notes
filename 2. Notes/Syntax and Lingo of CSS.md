This whole block is **CSS declaration**
```CSS
h1, h2 {           <- "Element Selector"  
  property: value;  <- "Declarations"
  color: red;      <- "Declarations"
  font-size: 5em;  <- "Declarations"
}
```
**Selector** - This _selects_ the HTML element that we are going to style. 

The whole declaration blocks are called **_CSS rulesets_**
