`href="mailto:example@yahoo.com"`
You can provide more info to `mailto`
In fact, any standard mail header fields can be added to the `mailto` URL you provide. 
The most commonly used of these are 
-> "subject", 
-> "cc", and 
-> "body" (which is not a true header field, but allows you to specify a short content message for the new email). 
Each field and its value is specified as a **query term**.
