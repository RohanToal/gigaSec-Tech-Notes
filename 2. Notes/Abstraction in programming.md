Basically we humans do abstraction all the time
We often ignore small unimportant details and only remember few important stuffs

However, if we take a way the abstraction, which computers does
If we ask them to get a cup of coffee, 
-> They will ask for 
- Will it in a mug or in styrofoam?
- Freshly Brewed, or concentrated?
- Does it come from Africa or America?
- and more seemingly unimportant questions
