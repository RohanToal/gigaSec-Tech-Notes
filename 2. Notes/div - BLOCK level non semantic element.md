`<div>`  `</div>`
**Warning:**Â 
Divs are so convenient to use that it's easy to use them too much. 
As they carry no semantic value, they just clutter your HTML code. 
Take care to use them only when there is no better semantic solution and try to reduce their usage to the minimum otherwise you'll have a hard time updating and maintaining your documents.
