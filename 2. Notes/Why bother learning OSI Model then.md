You would be justified in asking why we bother with the OSI model if it's not actually used for anything in the real-world. 


The answer to that question is quite simply that the OSI model (due to being less condensed and more rigid than the TCP/IP model) **tends to be easier for learning the initial theory of networking**. 

Also the concepts are kind of the same so learning OSI Model will help you easily learn TCP/IP Model or networking in general.
