Created:  [[2022-09-14]]

Peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. 
Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content 
(for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) 
but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.
-   [`<aside>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside)Â contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
