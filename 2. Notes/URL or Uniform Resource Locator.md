---
Two types of URL
[[Absolute URL]] - the full path
[[Relative URL]] - sort of shortcut path


These are all the features of a url. 
Note that it doesn't need to use all of them for the url to work
[[Scheme]] ---                              [[Host-Domain]] ---                                 [[Path]] ---                         [[Fragment]]

                            [[User]] ---                                        [[Port]] ---                                   [[Query String]]



## More
URL parameters: 
`GET` requests encode data in the URL sent to the server 
by adding **name/value pairs** onto the end of the link
For example 
`http://example.com?name=Fred&age=11`. 


URL parameters are inherently "insecure" as they can be changed by users and then resubmitted. 
As a result URL parameters/`GET` requests are not used for requests that update data on the server.
