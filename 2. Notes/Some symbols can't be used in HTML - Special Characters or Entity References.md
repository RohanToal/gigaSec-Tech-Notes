Using this symbols below will cause errors as this are part of HTML syntax itself
`<  >  "  '  &`

To print those symbols above as a text, use Character Reference or Special Characters
`<`  ->   `&lt;`
`>`  ->   `&gt;`
`"`  ->   `&quot;`
`'`  ->   `&apos;`
`&`  ->   `&amp;`


Special Characters are easy to identify as it follows a pattern:
- All starts with `&` and ends with `;`
- Text `lt` in `&lt;` means `less than`




**Note:** 
You don't need to use entity references for any other symbols, 
as modern browsers will handle the actual symbols just fine as long as your HTML's [character encoding is set to UTF-8](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#specifying_your_documents_character_encoding).
