[`<nav>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) links the site's main sections; 
Usually represented by 
- menu buttons, 
- links
- tabs. 


Navigation bar usually remains consistent in all webpages. 
Having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users.


Often people have different views about nav tag and [[header semantic tag in HTML]]
- Some says, Navigation bar is part of [[header semantic tag in HTML|header]] rather than an individual component, 
- Others says, Having the two separate is better forÂ accessibility as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.
