[[Recursion Explained]]


When you pass an array as a parameter to a function it decays into a pointer, this is defined in the C standard in `6.7.1`:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6645161/passing-address-of-array-as-a-function-parameter
> On entry to the function the value of each argument expression shall be converted to the type of its corresponding parameter, as if by [[assignment]] to the parameter. _Array expressions_ and function designators as arguments are _converted to pointers_ before the call. A declaration of a parameter as **“array of type” shall be adjusted to “pointer to type,**”
