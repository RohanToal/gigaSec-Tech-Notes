KornShell was invented by David Korn in 1983, then a computer scientist at Bell Labs, as a superset of features, enhancements, and improvements over the Bourne Shell (which it was backwards compatible with), which was invented by Stephen Bourne in 1977 who was also a computer scientist at Bell Labs.

**My Answer:** 
KornShell was invented in 1983 by David Korn who was a computer scientist at Bell labs. It was an improved superset version of Bourne Shell. It was invented by Stephen Bourne in 1977 who was also a computer scientist at Bell Labs.

 
**Improvements:**
The following two Bell Labs computer scientists invented popular shells:
-   Stephen Bourne invented the Bourne Shell in 1977.
-   David Korn invented the KornShell in 1983.

The KornShell is a backwards-compatible superset of the Bourne Shell, containing many improvements over the older shell.
