    Needs information on economic forecasts, technology trends, competitive threats and governmental issue. 


Middle Managers and Knowledge Workers
    Provide direction, necessary resources, and performance feedback to supervisors and team leaders
    Needs more detailed information than top managers


Supervisors and Team Leaders
    Oversee operational employees and carry out day-to-day functions
    Need decision support such as:
    - information, 
    - knowledge management systems 
    - user productivity systems


Operational Employees
    Rely on [[Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)]] to enter and receive data they need to perform their jobs
    Need decisions made by supervisors to handle tasks.

life-cycle development or rapid application development
The same methods are used by software vendors, which need to provide more general, customizable systems. Large organizational systems, such as enterprise systems, are generally developed and maintained through a [systematic](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/systematic) process, known as a [system life cycle](https://www.britannica.com/topic/system-life-cycle), which consists of six stages: feasibility study, system analysis, system design, programming and testing, installation, and operation and maintenance. The first five stages are system development proper, and the last stage is the long-term exploitation. Following a period of use (with maintenance as needed), the information system may be either phased out or upgraded. In the case of a major upgrade, the system enters another development life cycle.
