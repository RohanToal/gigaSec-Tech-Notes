### Auxiliary 
- modules, such as 
- scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.


### Encoders 
- Allows you to encode exploit and payload... 
- ...in hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.
[[Encoders have less success on signature-based antivirus, here's why]]


### Evasion 
- Tries to evade antivirus software but no guarantee of success. 


### [[Payload]] 
Exploits take advantage of vulnerability on target system, 
but to achieve desired result, we will need a [[payload]]. 

Metasploit has ability to send different [[payload]] that can open shells on the target system. Shells gives us the ability to execute system commands.

### Post 
Useful on the final stage of the penetration testing



### NOPs: NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally.
Represented in Intel x86 CPU family 
Represented with 0x90, 
Following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. 
-> **often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes**.
