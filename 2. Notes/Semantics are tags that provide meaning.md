Tags that provides meaning to html rather than just for appearance
For instance, we have `<h1></h1>` meaning a top level heading of a page. 

[[emphasis tag is not ITALIC]]
`<emphasis>` gives *stress* to words

[[strong tag is not BOLD]]
`<strong>` indicates importance and is not bold

`<span>` has no mearning in html. 
It gives appearance by using css or using javascript.

### Non Semantic Wrapper
[[No ideal semantic element to group items together - Non-Semantic Wrapper]]
`<div>` - **block level** non-semantic element
`<span>` - **inline** non-semantic element
`<hr>`
