We call binary on classical computers
We call `qubits` on quantum computers

## Features of Quantom Computers
- Superposition
- Entanglement
- Interference

### Superposition
So imagine there's a ball and an arrow inside of it. 
If it points up, that means `0`, 
if it points down, that means `1`. 
Cool thing about it is the arrow can point anywhere (**superposition**), 
    ^ So the closer arrow points to `up`, the higher the chance it is to be `0`, lower for it to be `1`
        ^ Like `0` has `80%` chance and `1` has `20%` chance

### Entaglement
So basically, it's the combination of `qubits`

### Quantum Algorithms
The idea is to have an algorithm that decreases the chance of destructive interference and increases the chance of constructive interference.

Destructive Interference means a value that dictates how likely it you get the wrong answer
Constructive Interference means same above, but the chance of getting RIGHT ANSWER.



## The basis of encryption schemes in credit cards etc..
Factoring large numbers is essentially hard for the classical computers.
It's hard in a way that the computer power can't handle it

However, a mathematical algorithm named "Shors Algorithm" can find the factors of a large number. It needs a quantum computer however.
