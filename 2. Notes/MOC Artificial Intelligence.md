# MOC Artificial Intelligence
I'm one of those people who thought arts and creativity would be the last hardest sector the AI would conquer. I do not know what to believe anymore. 

AI enables computers to understand certain kinds of data that they could not have understood before, such as natural language, auditory and visual data

## How does AI learn?
We provide machines the ability to examine examples and create "machine learning models" based on the inputs and desired outputs.
The following below are different ways we teach AI:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning


## Types of AI
### Weak / Narrow AI
It's an AI that functions in a specific domain
Below are the examples of Narrow AI:
- Languange Translators
- Virtual Assistant
- Self-Driving Cars
- AI-powered web searches
- Spam Filters

#### Applied AI 
This AI can learn specific tasks **but CAN'T learn** on their own
Decisions are made with:
- programmed algorithms
- training data

### Strong AI or Generalized AI
Can learn new tasks to solve new problems
It teaches itself with  new strategies

### Super AI or Concious AI
An AI that is fully concious and is self-aware of its existence
It's unlikely that we can't create concious AI soon because we haven't clearly defined what conciousness is

### Extras:
AI and ML basics
Deep Learning - ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM
Text Processing - TF-IDF, embedding
Python and Jupyter Notebooks
