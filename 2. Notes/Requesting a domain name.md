`1`. First, 
Computer checks LOCAL CACHE if you've PREVIOUSLY VISITED the address recently. 


IF a result is found locally in your computer
-> Address is sent back to your computer 
-> your request ends here. 



ELSE IF address wasn't found in local cache 
-> a request to [[Recursive DNS Server]] will be made.
