### Why data must be translated from Application Layer
Data received from [[7- Application Layer]] tends to be in format that only the sending computer understands, 
It's not necessarily in a standardised format that could be understood by the application layer in _receiving_ computer. 


**==Translates data into standardised format==**, 
**handles any encryption, compression** or other transformations to the data.
