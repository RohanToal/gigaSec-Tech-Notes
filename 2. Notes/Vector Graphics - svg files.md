But first, two types of images
- [[Raster Images]] - ( `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp` ) defined using grid of pixels
- [[Vector Images]] - ( `.svg` ) defined using algorithms

`.svg` 
is based on XML languange for describing [[Vector Images]]

Benefits of `.svg`
- Text in vector images remains accessible (which also benefits your SEO).
- **SVGs lend themselves well to styling/scripting**, because each component of the image is an element that can be styled via CSS or scripted via JavaScript.
