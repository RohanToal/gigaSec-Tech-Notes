Problem: Sometimes, CSS might not apply as you expected 
Reason: because something else in the stylesheet has more specificity.


CSS stands for **Cascading** Style Sheets, 
    and that first word _cascading_ is incredibly important to understand — 
The way cascade behaves is key to understanding CSS.


The following concepts together control which CSS applies to what element
- [[cascade]]
- [[specificity]]
- [[inheritance]]





[[CSS provides universal property values for controlling inheritance]]
