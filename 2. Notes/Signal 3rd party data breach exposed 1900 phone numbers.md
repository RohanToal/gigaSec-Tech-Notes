Twilio was hacked and signal uses twilio as their third party verification partner.

Lesson Learned
-> Encrypted messaging providers should stay away from phone numbers as verification as it can be vulnerable to [[Swim Swap Technique]].
-> Businesses are only secure as their tech partners, a slip from a third-party can cause same damage as direct assault.
