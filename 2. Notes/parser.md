A **parser** is a program that is part of the compiler, 
**parsing** is part of the compiling process. 

Parsing happens during the analysis stage of compilation:
1. code is taken from the preprocessor, 
2. code is broken into smaller pieces 
3. code then is analyzed so other software can understand it.




Parser is just a small part of the compiler
