#### Adding info about the html document
```HTML
<meta name="author" content="gigaSecure">
<meta name="description" content="This is the things etc..">
```
Basically, `name` and `content` must go together.
`name` attribute is basically the name of where the `content` must stay

Benefits of adding author
Useful to be able to understand who wrote the page, 
-> if you have any questions about the content and you would like to contact them.

Benefits of adding description
Useful as it incrase potential to make website appear higher in searches performed in search engines
-> This technique is widely known as Search Engine Optimization

Search Engine also finds the `description` attribute in `meta` to display it in the search result
```HTML
<meta name="description" content="The MDN Web Docs site
  provides information about Open Web technologies
  including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and
  progressive web apps.">
```
Below is what google search showed in the link description

!! Copy Pasted
**Note:** Many `<meta>` features just aren't used any more. 
For example, the keyword `<meta>` element (`<meta name="keywords" content="fill, in, your, keywords, here">`) — which is supposed to provide keywords for search engines to determine relevance of that page for different search terms — is ignored by search engines, because spammers were just filling the keyword list with hundreds of keywords, biasing results.
!! End of Copy Paste
