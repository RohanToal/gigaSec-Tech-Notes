Attributes are optionally added in the opening tag, [[Tags in HTML]]
Wrap values of attribute with  `""` for readability and normalization
```HTML
<tag attribute="value">
<html lang="en">
``` 



If attribute's value doesn't have spaces, the `""` can be omitted 
But **==for readability and normalization==, better to enclose values with `""`**
```HTML
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/> favorite website </a>
```
