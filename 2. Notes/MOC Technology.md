### Process of Note Taking
**Update after 2 months**

It seems like some aspect of zettelkasten are doing nothing, specifically 
- #fleeting 
- #literature 
- #permanent 
I am prioritizing adding information and less on organizing ideas. Therefore I am constantly editing permanent notes and creating fleeting notes. I think I am going to abandon this tag.

My system has leaned more towards progressize sumarization and less on zettelkasten. Meaning I have been organizing ideas more by accident or when I am working/studying on that particular area. 
For instance, if I have messy notes on SQL Injection and I am no longer studying about it, then I don't care how much of a mess it is, I will not organize it.

Benefits that stayed consistent
- All the things that I studied and that matters aren't forgetten or lost in the vault
- Usually the act of summarizing or organizing my notes here helps me remember stuffs more.
