### Process of Note Taking

It seems like some aspect of zettelkasten are doing nothing, specifically 
- #fleeting 
- #literature 
- #permanent 
I am prioritizing adding information than organizing idea. Therefore I am constantly editing permanent notes and creating fleeting notes. I think I am going to abandon this tag.

My system has leaned more towards progressize sumarization and less on zettelkasten. Meaning I have been organizing ideas more by accident or when I am working/studying on that particular area. 
For instance, if I have messy notes on SQL Injection and I am no longer studying about it, then I don't care how much of a mess it is, I will not organize it.

Benefits that stayed consistent
- All the things that I studied and that matters aren't forgetten or lost in the vault
- Usually the act of summarizing or organizing my notes here helps me remember stuffs more. 
- I understood things better and faster than writing it in a paper.


I have noticed my vault can act like a "read later" list. I'd say its better than pocket in firefox, or the integrated "reading list" in chromes. This apps often group the links in one place and sometimes, it could get hidden by the amount of newly added links. 

What I do is if I found a golden info and I don't have time to read or make my own conclusion about, I just get the link, dump it into whatever file it's related to. 

Either 
- I'm not gonna be able to read 
-  or In a few days, weeks or years I'll stumble on that note where the link is and it'll probably caught my interest and that I have a free time to read it. Then I could just 


Since I put an effort into making the title of a note, I know the keywords well that I can look it up in search bar.
