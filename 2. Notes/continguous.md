(adjective) Next to each other
- An example of contiguous isÂ **how Chile shares a border with Argentina**.


**In my own words:** It's like before the pandemic hits, my classmates and I were sitting next to each other. Basically we were sitted continguously. 

But now that pandemic is here, we're no longer sitted continguously but the internet is like a pointer, it connects us to each other despite livin in different locations.
