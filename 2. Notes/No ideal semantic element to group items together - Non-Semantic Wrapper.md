### [Non-semantic wrappers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure#non-semantic_wrappers "Permalink to Non-semantic wrappers")
Sometimes you'll come across a situation where:
- You can't find an ideal semantic element to wrap a content 
- You want to group set of elements together to affect them as single entity with CSS and JS

HTML provides the following elements to solve such issues above
- [[div - BLOCK level non semantic element]]  
- [[span - INLINE level non semantic element]]  
Use these preferably with a `class` atribute. It provides a label for it so they can be easily targeted.


`<hr>` denotes a thematic change
Visually it just looks like a horizontal line
