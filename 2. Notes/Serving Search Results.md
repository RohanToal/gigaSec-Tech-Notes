When a user enters a query, 
machines search the google index for matching pages 
return the results we believe are the highest quality and most relevant to the user

Search Console might tell you that a page is indexed, 
but you don't see it in search results. This might be because:
-   [The content of the content on page is irrelevant to users](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide)
-   [The quality of the content is low](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/overview)
-   [Robots meta directives prevent serving](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/block-indexing)
