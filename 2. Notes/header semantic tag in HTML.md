Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. 
This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
[`<header>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) represents a group of introductory content. 
If it is a child of [`<body>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) it defines the global header of a webpage, 

If it's a child of an [`<article>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) or [`<section>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) it defines a specific header for that section 
(try not to confuse this with [titles and headings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#adding_a_title)).
