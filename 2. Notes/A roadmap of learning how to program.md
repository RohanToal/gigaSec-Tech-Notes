## 1) Familiarize Yourself with Computer Architecture and Data Basics

We can create applications without knowing how hardware components works. 
That's also a concept called [[Abstraction in programming|abstraction]]. 

Learning computer architecture is basically about how hardware componenets works.

### But we're creating software! Not hardware, wtf is the point of learning that?
At the very least, being aware of a few things about it 
will help you navigate 
-> workplace conversations about high CPU and memory usage.


## 2) Learn how programming languanges work
Like understand the differences between 
interpreted languages and compiled language
because both have different ways of doing error handling, performance and etc..

## 3) Understand how internet works (how computers communicate to each other)

Think of Internet as a very large set of computers that can transfer ones and zeros amongst themselves, in a way that preserves the meaning of that data.
The Internet is nothing more than a digital conversation medium.

He recommends VIM, CLI, then HTML, CSS
