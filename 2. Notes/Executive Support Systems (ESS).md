Created:  [[2022-10-01]]

---
The ESS is like the MIS **but for executive-level decision-making**.  

The decisions involve company-wide matters, so the stakes are higher. 
Consequently, **they demand more insight and judgment.**

The ESS provides the following than the DSS
- greater telecommunication, 
- better computing capabilities, 
- more efficient display options .

Executives use ESS to make effective decisions 
    through summarized internal data taken from DSS and MIS and external sources. 

In addition, executive support systems help:
- monitor performances, 
- track competitors, 
- spot opportunities, 
- forecast future trends.
