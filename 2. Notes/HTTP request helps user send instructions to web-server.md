HTTP request helps user send instructions to web-server such as:
- getting informations
- updating informations
- deleting informations


The following are the instructions that we send to the server:
-   A [[URL or Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] identifying the target server and resource (e.g. an HTML file).
-   A [[Methods - defines the actions required for the web server to perform|method]] that defines the required action.  
     

[[example of HTTP reQUEST by CLIENT]]
Web servers wait for 
1. client request messages, 
2. process them when they arrive, 
3. reply to the web browser with an [[HTTP Response Status Codes]]. 






Additional information can be encoded with the request (for example, HTML form data). Information can be encoded as:
-   [[Cookies 101|Client-side cookies]]. Cookies contain session data about the client, including keys that the server can use to determine their login status and permissions/accesses to resources.
