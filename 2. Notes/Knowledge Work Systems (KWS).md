- ensures that business's technical skills are correctly applied. 

The KWS uses the following to **aid in creating and disseminating new information**:
- graphics 
- communication
- document management tools

Examples of KWS:
- Computer-Aided Design Systems (CAD): 
- Financial Workstations
    These systems pull and combine data from many different internal and external sources, covering research reports, market data, and management data. Financial workstations can rapidly analyze huge amounts of financial data and trading situations.
- Virtual Reality Systems: 
    These systems take the CAD system to the next level, using interactive graphics utilities to create realistic computer-generated simulations. VR systems are typically found in scientific, educational, and business circles.
