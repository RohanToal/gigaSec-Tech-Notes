Login page is vulnerable to sql injection



## Micro-SMS

So there's an image link that's unavailable
https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54e8ba93e4b07c3f655b452e/t/56c2a04520c64707756f4267/1493764650017/
It says, cannot be displayed because it contains errors. 
This is not a just a paragraph thing since the server did return `404 not found`

The link above says
Forbidden
You don't have the permission to access the requested resource. It is either read-protected or not readable by the server.

1st Flag Found! :D
It suddenly click to me that you can edit files. 
We could still edit the file by accessing `page/edit/7` and that's how I saw the flag :D
