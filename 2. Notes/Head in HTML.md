The Job of Head is to have a place for  
- `<title>`  
- links to css, custom favicons
- `<meta> `


`<title>`
Bookmarks in browsers grabs the `<title>` as to make it the name of the bookmark

 `<meta>`
There are many different attributes to `<meta>` tag
- [[charset  attribute (specifies character encoding)]]  
- [[name, content attributes (adding info of html document)]]
- [[property, content]] 

### Adding Custom Icons
Favicon
Better to have image with filename `.ico` as it supports all the way back to Internet Explorer 6
But it can accept `.gif` or `.png`  #myquestion Wonder if it can ask `.jpeg` too?


### [[Linking CSS and Javascript in HTML]]

### Set the primary languange of the page
```HTML
<html lang="en-US">
```
-> Your HTML document will be indexed more effectively by search engines if its language is set (allowing it to appear correctly in language-specific results, for example)
-> it is useful to people with visual impairments using screen readers (for example, the word "six" exists in both French and English, but is pronounced differently.)
