==Active Voice== Sentence follows the formula below
- **actor** + verb + target


Example:
**The cat** sat on the mat.
-   **actor**: The cat
-   verb: sat
-   target: the mat


Sentences that start with [[imperative verb]] are typically in ==active voice==, 
even though there's no explicit mention of an actor.
instead, sentences that start with an [[imperative verb]] imply an actor and that actor is **you**.
for example
1.  **Open** the configuration file.
2.  **Set** the frombus variable to false.
