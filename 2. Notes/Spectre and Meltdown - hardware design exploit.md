This are basically a cpu architecture bug. It's a hardware design flaw that the true fix is too redesign the hardware architecture itself. Both bugs below are known to be local attacks

**[CVE-2017-5754](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754) — Rogue Data Cache Load a.k.a Meltdown**


A cpu [[vulnerability]] that allows a user-mode program to access kernel-mode memory.
It [[exploit]]s a flaw called "[[speculative execution]]". Basically it predicts the upcoming instructions cpu receives and execute them ahead of time. A malicious program can use this [[exploit]] to access sensitive information in memory and by extension, of other programs and the OS itself.

The bug affects all Intel Processors since 1995 with the exception of Itanium and older Atom CPUs. OS updates can be performed for Meltdown bug poses performance hit on CPU.

**[CVE-2017-5753](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753) — Bounds Check Bypass a.k.a Spectre Variant 1 
[CVE-2017-5715](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715) — Branch Target Injection a.k.a Spectre Variant 2**
Spectre also exploits [[speculative execution]]
If your PC is not patched for Spectre, 
THEN a hacker who has local access to your computer can steal sensitive information that...
... you enter in a browser form, for example
Spectre can be used to exploit browser-based JavaScript
However, spectre are read-only attacks, means hackers can only read the information being executed but not force anything on their own. 
Still, the possible sensitivity of the information that can be leaked warrants that these vulnerabilities be addressed quickly.
