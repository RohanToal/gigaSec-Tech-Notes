Contains most of the unique content of a given webpage,
For example,
- The video you want to watch, 
- the main story you're reading, 
- the map you want to view


Rules to follow when using `<main>`
- Use `<main>` only _once_ per page, and put it directly inside of body
- Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
- Consistency to every webpage isn't needed here.
