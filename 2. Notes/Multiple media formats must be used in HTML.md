Different browsers support different video / audio formats AND different [[Media Container Formats]] 
-   A `WebM` container typically packages Vorbis or Opus audio with VP8/VP9 video. This is supported in all modern browsers, though older versions may not work.
-   An MP4 container often packages AAC or MP3 audio with H.264 video. This is also supported in all modern browsers, as well as Internet Explorer.
-   The Ogg container tends to use Vorbis audio and Theora video. This is best supported in Firefox and Chrome, but has basically been superseded by the better quality WebM format.
