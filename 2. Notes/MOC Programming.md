Programming in a nutshell
The computer will do exactly what you tell it to do and doesn't attempt to figure out what you actually want to do, unless if it's github copilot ;-;

Do you know what a CDN is? Every time you've jacked off to porn on the internet, that single porn video was uploaded to a single data center endpoint, but then the CDN automatically replicates that porn video to data centers all around the world so when you pull up "Jennifer White gets boned" on your shitty handheld smartphone, you get a fast delivery response with little to no latency so you can jack off to your ~~dick's~~ content.

Hell, Reddit uses a CDN. Check out [**Reddit's status page**](https://reddit.statuspage.io). You'll see they use Fastly. If you look at [**Reddit's Infrastructure AMA**](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9x577m/were_reddits_infrastructure_team_ask_us_anything/), you'll see they also use Akamai.


## Random Thoughts:
It's like reading a tutorial about learning how to make music, but the problem is, its written in chinese, and if you absolutely don't know anything about chinese then you wouldn't understand anything.
That's basically how every beginners start out. Some seek advices and get the "read the documentation, you will learn so much there". That's absolutely true but as a beginner, reading it... nothing ever makes sense. This creates a discouragement because documentations are written in English and they'd expect to just look up the definition and it will make sense. But no, some programming lingo requires hands-on exercise to fully understand it. 
It's a long journey, you'd spend time learning about the lingo of programming. There's a reason why university students spend four years. 



The ability to quickly learn is the most powerful skill one can have than the amount of knowledge someone has. 
As I was watching the OPEN-Ai vs OG Pro Players in Dota 2, the OpenAI in the first round of the match played stupidly and played noob moves, that surely made them lost the game. As the 2nd round, OpenAI now has a previous memory of how OG Pro players played and with that experience, they learned from it and even surpass the OG Team and that for sure made them win. What's even more amazing is they usually make decisions that otherwise wouldn't do if a human was playing it. For instance, the OpenAI frequently do a `buyback` where in not a pro player would usually do so.
I think this is where AI reigns over the humans, no matter how stupid or unknowledgable the AI is, once it experiences something, it will quickly learn from it and they'll quickly understood what's happening.


As what we are as a human now, we sit comfortably at the top of hierarchy of the land species. We are considerably the most brilliant if not one of the intelligient species on this planet. However, the ability for us to realize how dumb we are, or is it really a matter of how dumb we are? Because, I think it simply means a lack of information and understanding. Basically my initial point was to make an assertion. That is higher form of intelligience in species means the ability to recognize how dumb and stupid one's own specie can be. I say this because I read an article about social engineering and how easily people can be deceived by such things, but then again, they are easily deceived simply because of lack of information, that is not knowing that this kind of things exists. Or is it really a lack of information? Because we humans can be emotionally-driven. For instance, when our mental capacities are not in the best form (such as in stress, low energy or depression) our decisions often tilt towards making more emotionally-driven choices rather than intellectual rational ones. That's where social engineering exploits and take advantage of human nature.       

Programming languanges is like OS.
We can say that Windows, for users who just want an out of the box experience. You only are given limited freedom to customize your OS. You take what you are fed with.
However, Linux in general is designed for users who want more control of their system.
And to do this, you'd need a good understanding of linux

We can say the same with languanges.
Python feeds you with precompiled C languange (sort of) then gives you an automatic garbage collector. 
However, C/Assembly rarely hold your hands during the journey. Youd have to do the assigning of data type yourself, garbage collecting, assigning memory, creating your own functions.
To do this, you'd need a really good understanding of C/Assembly. 


You see, Coding is like Math. When you think of it this way, math is pretty useless, it's just numbers, numbers. What can numbers do? Nothing, but every great engineering inventions heavily used math. 
When you're starting out, you'd often have a motivation to learn programming to make something useful for you but a lot of times, you'd be learning something that you'd feel like it's not useful at all. This sometimes is a failure to the teacher as he/she didn't highlight the importance of learning this particular topic. When I first started out, I was gi

Python is good for beginners to get into but once you branch out to other languanges, you're gonna have a hard time adopting to it. 



It's important to learn the lingo so that you'll know what to google, you'll know how to get the answers asap.
