Entity Rereferences
`<  >  "  '  &`

This are special characters, meaning they are part of the HTML syntax
They interpret it as a code instead of a text
To read it as a text, you can use Character Reference
`<`  ->   `&lt;`
`>`  ->   `&gt;`
`"`  ->   `&quot;`
`'`  ->   `&apos;`
`&`  ->   `&amp;`

Easy to remember 
-> as `<` goes with `lt`, meaning less than
-> all character reference starts with `&` and ends with `;`


**Note:** 
You don't need to use entity references for any other symbols, as modern browsers will handle the actual symbols just fine as long as your HTML's [character encoding is set to UTF-8](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#specifying_your_documents_character_encoding).
