**HTTP is stateless** ==(doesn't keep track of previous requests)== 
Therefore can't remember who you are,
thus **==cookies are used to remember you==** like personal settings for website or whether you've visited the website before.  


Cookies are **also used for website authentication**, 
so that users no longer need to type their username and password out.
