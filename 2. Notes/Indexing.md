### Indexing
After a page is crawled, Google tries to understand what the page is about

it includes processing and analyzing the 
    textual content and 
    key content tags  
    attributes, such as [`<title>` elements](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/title-link) 
    and alt attributes such as [images](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/google-images), [videos](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/video), and more.

During the indexing process, 
Google determines if a page is a [duplicate of another page on the internet or canonical](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/consolidate-duplicate-urls).

Google also collects *signals* about the canonical page and its contents, 
which may be used in the next stage, where we serve the page in search results. 
Some signals include 
    the language of the page, 
    the country the content is local to, 
    the usability of the page
    and so on.

The collected information about the canonical page and its cluster may be stored in the Google index, 
However, Indexing isn't guaranteed; not every page that Google processes will be indexed.
