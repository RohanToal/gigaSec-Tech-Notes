Luna is very simple ransomware still under development 
and with limited capabilities based on the available command line options.

The encryption scheme is a not so common one
It's a combination between
- X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve2259
- and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm

## Rust-based cross-platform ransomware

Using a cross-platform language also 
enables Luna ransomware to evade automated static code analysis attempts.

**It seems like cybercrime gangs are developing cross-platform ransomware** like rust
**The goal is to create malware capable of targeting multiple operating system**
