Linux: `traceroute <destination>`


**Allows you to ==see each steps of the servers visited when trying to access a resource**==. The internet is made up of many different servers and end-points that are all networked up to each other. In order to get to the content you want, you first need to go through a bunch of servers. 



**Windows**  `tracert`. 
Uses [[ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP Protocol]] that [[Ping command for testing a connection|ping]] utilises.


**Unix** `traceroute` 
Operates over [[UDP - User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. 


**Protocol used between different OS ==can be altered==** but they also **have their defaults**
