# Initialization in programming explained

```C
int lower = 50; //A variable can be initalized in its declaration
```
`initalization` is the act of assigning a value to a variable in its [[Declaration]].


External and static variables 
-> are initialized to zero by default.

[[Automatic variables]] Local Varaibles for which is no explicit initializer 
-> have undefined (i.e., garbage) values.
