Log4j records events - errors and routine system operations and communicates diagnostic messages about them to system administrators and users. Open source software by Apache Software Foundation.

### Log4j and where its used
Overall, it's common use is to keep logs 

1. In minecraft, used by server to log activity like total memory used or commands typed in console

2. When you type in a bad web link and got a [[HTTP Status Codes|404]] error message. The web server running the domain of the web link you tried to get to tells you there's no such webpage. That also gets recorded in a log for server's system adminitrator.

### How Log4jSHELL works
Abuses the feature in Log4j that allows users to specify custom code for formatting a log message. 

Log4j allows 3rd-party servers to submit software code that can perform all kinds of actions on the targeted computer.
- Stealing sensitive info
- Taking control of the targeted system 
- Slipping malicious content to other users communicating with affected server


### How hackers try to find services which uses LOG4J
setting up machines that can deliver malicious [[Payload]]. 

To carry out an attack, they query services like web servers 
Trying to trigger log message like 404 error
The query includes malciiously crafted text, which Log4j dumbly processes as instructions

These instructions creates 
- reverse shell - allows attacker to remotely control target server 
- botnets - helps carry out coordinated attacks on behalf of the hackers


### Log4j is everywhere and that's the problem
Basically logging is a fundamental feature of most software 
and, most often rely on third party apps such as log4j
- Cloud services such as apple icloud, amazon web services
- Wide range of software development and security tools

! Log4j is often deeply embedded in code 
! hidden from view due to being called in by indirect dependencies.

Making matters worse, according to CSRB, 
“There is no comprehensive ‘customer list’ for Log4j or even a list of where it is integrated as a subsystem.”


Because Log4j is everywhere
Hackers have a large menu of targets to choose from:
- Home users, Security Researches
- Service Providers, Source Code Developers




### How to defend from Log4j Attack
As a user, it's hard to know whether a software product you are using includes Log4j and whether it is using vulnerable versions of the software.

However
**Make sure all of your software is up to date.**
