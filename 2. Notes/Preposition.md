Preposition - specificies the positional relationship of two nouns.
Example: Sam is **on** the bridge.

-   The submenu lies **under** the menu.
-   The definition appears **next to** the term.
-   The `print` function falls **within** the main routine.


Other prepositions answer the question, "_When_ is this event relative to that other event?" For example:
-   The program evaluates the addition operation **before** evaluating the subtraction operation.
-   The cron daemon executes the script every Tuesday **at** noon.


A few prepositions (for example, **by** and **of**) answer other kinds of questions about relationships. For example, the following sentence uses **by** to relate a book to its authors:

-   _The C Programming Language_ **by** Kernighan and Richie remains popular.


**Note:** Some English words fall into multiple grammatical categories. 
For example,  
    **under** is usually a *preposition*, 
    but context affects the sentence 
        meaning **under** can also serve as an [[adverb]] or [[adjective]] depending on context.
