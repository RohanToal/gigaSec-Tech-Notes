Inline quotations uses the [`<q>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q) element. For example, the below bit of markup contains a quotation from the MDN `<q>` page:

```HTML
<p>The quote element q — is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>
```
Browser renders inline quotations as text in quotes by default.
