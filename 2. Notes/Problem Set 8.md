1. Contain at least FOUR different `.html` pages, 
2. At least one of which is `index.html` (the main page of your website), 
3. Should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.


1. Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags BUT NOT 
- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`. 
Using some tag (e.g., `<p>`) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!


1. Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. 
Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. 
To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include
```HTML
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    ```
    
in your pages’ `<head>`, below which you can also include
```HTMl
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
to link your own CSS.



1. one stylesheet file of your own creation, `styles.css`, 
2. uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors 
    (e.g. tag (`example`), class (`.example`), or ID (`#example`)), 
3. a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, 
    such as `font-size`, or `margin`; and


1. Integrate one or more features of JavaScript into your site to make your site more interactive. For example, you can use JavaScript to add alerts, to have an effect at a recurring interval, or to add interactivity to buttons, dropdowns, or forms. Feel free to be creative!

  1. Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.

Learn Bootstrap first
