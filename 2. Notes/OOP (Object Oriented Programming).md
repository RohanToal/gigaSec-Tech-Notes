OOP is made up of an **OBJECT**
Object must have these two things
- State
- Behavior

A lamp would be a good object
State -> Lamps have different types of bulbs
Behavior -> They can be turned off/on

Rather than having a list of different types of bulb
You can just use OOP to simply 
-> Change the type of bulb
-> Change the behavior of the bulb
