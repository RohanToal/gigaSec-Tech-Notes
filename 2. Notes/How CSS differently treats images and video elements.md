In this lesson 
    we will take a look at how certain special elements are treated in CSS


### Images and Video
Images and video are described asÂ **[replaced elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element)**.
Means, 
    CSS cannot affect the internal layout of these elements.
    Only their position on the page amongst other elements.

They have Aspect Ratio (meaning have X and Y dimensions)
By default, browsers displays the intrinsic dimensions of the file
