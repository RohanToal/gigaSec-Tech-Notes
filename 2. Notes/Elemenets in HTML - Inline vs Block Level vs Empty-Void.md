### Inline Element
```HTML
<em>first</em> <em>second</em> <em>third</em>
```
`<em>` is an inline element
Creates an italic -> *first second third*
Each element provided no newline when used 

In Conclusion, both Inline Element and Block-Level Element are terms dropped in HTML5 because it creates a confusion with the CSS tings

### Block-Level Element
```HTML
<p>fourth</p> <p>fifth</p> <p>sixth</p>
```
`<p>` is a block-level Element
It creates newline at each element
fourth
fifth
sixth

In Conclusion, both Inline Element and Block-Level Element are terms dropped in HTML5 because it creates a confusion with the CSS tings. The terms _block_ and _inline_, as used in this article, should not be confused with [the types of CSS boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#types_of_css_boxes) that have the same names.
