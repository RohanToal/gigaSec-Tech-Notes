The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. It began as an academic research project in 1969, and became a global commercial network in the 1990s.

The internet began as [[ARPANET]], an academic research network that was funded by the military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA). The project was led by [Bob Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)), an ARPA administrator, and the network was built by the consulting firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman. It began operations in 1969.

During the 1980s, funding for the internet shifted from the military to the [National Science Foundation.](http://www.nsf.gov/) The NSF funded the long-distance networks that served as the internet’s backbone from 1981 until 1994. In 1994, the Clinton Administration [turned control](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/business/us-begins-privatizing-internet-s-operations.html) over the internet backbone to the private sector. It has been privately operated and funded ever since.
