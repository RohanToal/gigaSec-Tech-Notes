But first, remember this 

==**Each note has a `hyperlink` at the top**== 
^--> Purpose is go back from where the note came from. 
Update: "*That's a lie, there are files that doesn't have hyperlink.*" Yeah, sometimes I forgot :P


==**Got Lost**?==
^--> ~~Always come back to your **+HOME** file located at -> `3. Notes/+Home`.~~
Update: `+HOME` file was renamed and is now `MOC Technology`
Reason: I have to change the filename to keep my Tech Notes in sync with my personal vault.

The following below are the steps in case you got lost
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` to search for files. (Right Side)
- Start Typing `file:MOC Technology`
- Click the `MOC Technology` file that appears in the search results


#### Proceed here -> [[MOC Technology]]
