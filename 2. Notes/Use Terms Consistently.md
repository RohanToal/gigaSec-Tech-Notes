Use Terms Consistently
If you change the name of a variable midway through a method, your code won’t compile. Similarly, if you rename a term in the middle of a document, your ideas won’t compile (in your users’ heads).

The moral: apply the same unambiguous word or term consistently throughout your document.

Example:
    **Protocol Buffers** provide their own definition language. 
    Blah, blah, blah. And that's why **protobufs** have won so many county fairs.
