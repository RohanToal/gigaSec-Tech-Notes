Linux makes devices as sort of files and they are stored in `/dev`
Sort of, because these are not actual files as we know them, but they appear as files

For example, 
`/dev/sda` represents the first SATA drive in the system. 
If you wanted to partition it, you could start a partition editor and tell it to edit `/dev/sda`
