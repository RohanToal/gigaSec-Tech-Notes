```HTML
<em>first</em> <em>second</em> <em>third</em>
```
`<em>` is an inline element
Purpose: Creates an italic -> *first second third*
No newline is generated when `<em>` is used. 




Note:
*block* and *inline* should not be confused with respective terms in [the types of CSS boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#types_of_css_boxes)
