# Quick Guide
![[gigasecure.jpg|100]]
**Welcome!** 
This obsidian vault is made by **==gigaSec==**
I'm delighted to share with y'all the things that I learned during my studying sessions. 

From here on, you can either do the following:
1. Understand how I use my vault -> [[Guide on how to use my vault]]
2. Skip reading and immediately go to the vault  -> [[MOC Technology]]


You **can still go back in this guide** by doing the following:
1. Press `ctrl + shift + f`
2. Type `file: introductio`
