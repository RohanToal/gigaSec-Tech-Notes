---


Segmentation Fault = You touched a memory that you shouldn't


Truncated = Ended abruptly at one spot. For instance 3.453 turns into 3.4  
It's the same of rounding that it reduces digits but that's only it, truncating doesn't change digits, only removes them.


Buffer in programming is a temporary placeholder. Used a lot in context of transferring data from something to another.

Random Thoughts:
It's like reading a tutorial about learning how to make music, but its written in chinese, and if you absolutely don't know anything about chinese then you wouldn't understand anything.

That's basically how every beginners start out. Some seek advices and get the "read the documentation, you will learn so much there" but as a beginner, reading it nothing ever makes sense. This creates a discouragement because documentations are written in English and they'd expect to just look up the definition and it will make sense. But no, some programming lingo requires hands-on exercise for someone to fully understand it, (like recursion). 

It's a long journey, you'd spend time learning about the lingo of programming.
