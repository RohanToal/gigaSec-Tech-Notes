[[Advice I found in reddit about programming]]


---


Segmentation Fault = You touched a memory that you shouldn't


Truncated = Ended abruptly at one spot. For instance 3.453 turns into 3.4

Buffer in programming is a temporary placeholder. Used a lot in context of transferring data from something to another.
