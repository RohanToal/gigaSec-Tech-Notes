---


Segmentation Fault = You touched a memory that you shouldn't


Truncated = Ended abruptly at one spot. For instance 3.453 turns into 3.4  
It's the same of rounding that it reduces digits but that's only it, truncating doesn't change digits, only removes them.


Buffer in programming is a temporary placeholder. Used a lot in context of transferring data from something to another.

Random Thoughts:
It's like reading a tutorial about learning how to make music, but the problem is, its written in chinese, and if you absolutely don't know anything about chinese then you wouldn't understand anything.

That's basically how every beginners start out. Some seek advices and get the "read the documentation, you will learn so much there". That's absolutely true but as a beginner, reading it... nothing ever makes sense. This creates a discouragement because documentations are written in English and they'd expect to just look up the definition and it will make sense. But no, some programming lingo requires hands-on exercise to fully understand it. 

It's a long journey, you'd spend time learning about the lingo of programming. There's a reason why university students spend four years. 



The ability to quickly learn is the most powerful skill one can have than the amount of knowledge someone has. 
As I was watching the OPEN-Ai vs OG Pro Players in Dota 2, the OpenAI in the first round of the match played stupidly and played noob moves, that surely made them lost the game. As the 2nd round, OpenAI now has a previous memory of how OG Pro players played and with that experience, they learned from it and even surpass the OG Team and that for sure made them win. What's even more amazing is they usually make decisions that otherwise wouldn't do if a human was playing it. For instance, the OpenAI frequently do a `buyback` where in not a pro player would usually do so.
I think this is where AI reigns over the humans, no matter how stupid or unknowledgable the AI is, once it experiences something, it will quickly learn from it and they'll quickly understood what's happening.
