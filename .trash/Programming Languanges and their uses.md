 Python is interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming language. 
 It emphasizes code readability with it's use of indentation. 
 
 **Where is python used?** 
 Python is a very diverse language, and can be used in many different situations. 
 Some popular ones are listed below 
 ▪︎ Backend development with Django: 
 ▪︎ Databases with python (mongoDB): 
 ▪︎ Data Science - Basics: 
 ▪︎ Data Science - Machine Learning: 
 ▪︎ Data Science - Deep Learning: 


## Javascript
-    **![:C_JavaScript:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/903036002334048317.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) JavaScript** 
JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
It is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. 
It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, first-class functions

JavaScript is mainly used in APIs, Websites and Bots.
