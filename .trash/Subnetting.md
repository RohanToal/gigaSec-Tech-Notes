****Subnetting** is the term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself. 

Example:
- Think of it as slicing up a cake for your friends. 
- There's only a certain amount of cake to go around, but everybody wants a piece. 
- Subnetting is you deciding who gets what slice & reserving such a slice of the cake.
