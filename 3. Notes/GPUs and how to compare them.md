How to compare GPUs
- It's very hard to compare GPUs through specifications alone since both NVIDIA and AMD's architectures are wildly different. 
- Paper Specifications are **not good indicator** of what kind of performance you can expect from GPU hardware. 
- You can't just go with an NVIDIA GPU because it has thousands more CUDA Cores than a comparable AMD Card and you can't just go with an AMD GPU for the same reasons. 
- **Solution:** Use real world benchmarks results.
