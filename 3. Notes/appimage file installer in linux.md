It's like a portable app in windows.
You delete the `.appimage`, and the file is gone.
`.appimage` doesn't install anything

Appimage doesn't need root permission
Appimage doesn't really install software
-> It is compressed image with all dependancies/libraries needed 

However, other softwares will prompt you to install.
If you allow it, the app will be installed on your linux system


## Steps to use `.appimage` file
Right Click
Go to Properties
Go to Permissions
Go to "Allow execute file as program"
