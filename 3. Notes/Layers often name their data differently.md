In layers 7, 6, 5, 
The data is simply referred to as **==data==**. 

In [[4 - Transport Layer]] the encapsulated data is referred to as a **==segment or a datagram==**. 


At [[3 - Network Layer]] the data is referred to as a **==packet==**. 


When the packet gets passed down to the [[2 - Data Link Layer]]  it becomes a **==frame==**.


By the time it's transmitted across a network the frame has been broken down into **==bits==**.
