Clarifying Concepts
Exploit: A code that takes advantage of `vulnerability` present on system.
Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system.
Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. 
    **However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want** (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.
