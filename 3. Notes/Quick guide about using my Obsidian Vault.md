**My vault matches with the theme of the system.** 
- If windows is on dark mode, obsidian will be on dark mode
- If windows is light mode, obsidian will be in light mode
Update: I haven't checked it so this feature above probably doesn't work by default

**You can manually switch to dark mode or light mode**
- `Ctrl + Shift + D` to Dark mode
- `Ctrl + Shift + L` to Light mode
- Or simply press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type `Dark Mode` or `Light Mode` Â 


**All Deleted Files goes to .trash folder which is hidden**
