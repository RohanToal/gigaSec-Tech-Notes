The articles idea is instead of javascript focusing it to improves its features, It has now become bloated. The Javascript creator invented the languange for 10 days, he knew that mistakes will soon pop up thus he made the languange malleable. The malleableness of the languange is also the reason why Javascript made its success because developers have the freedome to create it whatever they want.
