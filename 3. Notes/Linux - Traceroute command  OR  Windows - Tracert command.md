Linux: `traceroute <destination>`


**Traceroute allows you to ==see each steps of the servers visited when trying to access a resource**==. The internet is made up of many different servers and end-points that are all networked up to each other. In order to get to the content you want, you first need to go through a bunch of servers. 



**Protocol used between different OS ==can be altered==** but they also **have their defaults**

**Windows**  `tracert`. 
Uses same ICMP protocol that [[Ping command for testing a connection]] utilises.

**Unix** `traceroute` 
Operates over UDP.
