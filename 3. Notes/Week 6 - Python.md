Python is an [[Interpreted Language]] 

When Running a python program
-> `Source Code` is compiled into `Bytecode`
-> `Bytecode` is cached and stored in `.pyc` file. (runs faster after the first execution of file)

 
When source code is being modified, 
Will be recompiled and new bytecode files will be created again. 
**HOWEVER** in some occasions this may not be true --^
**Problem:** Python will execute the code using cached files causing you some troubles. 
                For instance, you fixed a bug but Python runs the buggy cached version
