Python is an [[Interpreted Language]] 

When Running a python program
-> `Source Code` is compiled into `Bytecode`
-> `Bytecode` is cached and stored in `.pyc` file. (Will be faster next time you re-runP the code)

It turns out, we can cache, or save, the interpreted version of our Python program, so it runs faster after the first time. And Python is actually partially compiled too, into an intermediate step called bytecode, which is then run by the interpreter.
