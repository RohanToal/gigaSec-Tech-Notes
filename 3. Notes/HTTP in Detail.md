HTTP  
**set of rules** for **==communicating with [[Web server and different ways we make request to it|web servers]] for the sending of webpage data==, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc**. 


HTTP
**stateless (doesn't keep track of previous requests)** 
therefore can't remember who you are 
thus [[Why are cookies used in HTTP|cookies]] are used to remember you .


### [[How communication happens between webserver and client-user]]
To access a website, you send a [[example of HTTP reQUEST by CLIENT|request]] to the webserver. 
Webserver will give a [[example of HTTP reSPONSE from WEBSERVER|response]] to you 
If response `OK`, files required to display website will be sent to your computer.
