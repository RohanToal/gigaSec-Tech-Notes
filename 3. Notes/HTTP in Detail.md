HTTP is the **set of rules** used for **==communicating with [[Web server and different ways we make request to it|web servers]] for the sending of webpage data==, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc**.



### [[How communication happens between webserver and client-user]]
To access a website, you send a [[HTTPS example of REQUEST by CLIENT to webserver|request]] to the webserver. It will give a [[HTTPS example of RESPONSE from WEBSERVER to client-user|response]] to you and if the response is Ok, the files that's required to display the website will be sent to your computer.
