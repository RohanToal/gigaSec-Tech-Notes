HTTP is the **set of rules** used for **==communicating with [[Web server and different ways we make request to it|web servers]] for the sending of webpage data==, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc**. 

HTTP is stateless (doesn't keep track of previous requests) therefore can't remember who you are, thus [[Why are cookies used in HTTP|cookies]] are used to remember you .


### [[How communication happens between webserver and client-user]]
To access a website, you send a [[HTTPS example of REQUEST by CLIENT to webserver|request]] to the webserver. It will give a [[HTTPS example of RESPONSE from WEBSERVER to client-user|response]] to you and if the response is Ok, the files that's required to display the website will be sent to your computer.
