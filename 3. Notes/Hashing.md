Abstract:

**Hashing:**Â 
storing and retrieving data as fast as possible. 

process of mapping keys and values into hash table
Efficiency of mapping depends on hash function used


Let a hash function `H(x)` maps the value of `x` at index `x%10` in an array.

So, the way hashing works is when you want to know where a value is stored in an array. Then you can just pass that value in that hash function and that will return an index of where the value is stored in the array.
