Abstract:


---

1. The last nodes of the tree is called 'leaves'
2. Process of navigating the tree is "traversal"
3. A node with at least one child is called "internal node"
4. Total number of children of a node is "degree of that node"
5. The number of edges from node A to root node is the "depth of the node"
6. The number of edges from root node to leaf is the "height of the node"



Red-Black Tree
- The Red-Black tree is one such configuration of the binary search tree that makes the insertion and deletion process more efficient.

Binary Tree
- The largest number is at the rightside, the smallest number is on the leftside
- Just like in binary number system where there's only two digits, the binary tree also only have maximum two subtree/child that a parent can have.
