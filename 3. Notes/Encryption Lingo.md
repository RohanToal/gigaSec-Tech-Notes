-> Easily reversible


**CIPHER** -> method of `encryption`/decryption data
**CIPHERTEXT** -> result of plaintext to encrypted data


**Key** -> needed to DECRPYT `ciphertext` to plaintext
**Passphrase** -> used to PROTECT the `key` (like a password but for `key`)


**Cryptanalysis** -> Attacking cryptography by finding weaknesses in its math
