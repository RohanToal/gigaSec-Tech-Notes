## Offensive security 
- breaks into computer systems, 
- exploiting software bugs, and 
- finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.

To beat a hacker, you need to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cybercriminal does.


## Defensive Security, 
- investigating infected computers to understand how it was hacked
- tracking down cybercriminals 
- monitoring infrastructure forÂ malicious activity.

### Security Analyst deals with detecting attacks  
Monitor various systems in the organisation and detect whether any of these systems are being attacked.

To do this, you need to understand how underlying technologies work and then understand what attacks against these technologies look like.


### Incident Responder

To do this, you need to know how underlying technologies work and what potential attacks could be carried out against a system. They 


### Malware analysis  
Understands what a malware is exactly doing thus possibily creating a plan to prevent further abuse

Malicious Hackers would
