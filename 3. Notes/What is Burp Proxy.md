At the simplest level, Burp can capture and manipulate all of the traffic between an attacker and a webserver: this is the core of the framework
After capturing requests, we can choose to send them to various other parts of the Burp Suite framework
This ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests prior to them being sent to the target server (or, in some cases, the responses before they are received by our browser), makes Burp Suite perfect for any kind of manual web app testing.
