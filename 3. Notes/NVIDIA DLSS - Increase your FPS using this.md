# DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling)

**Tldr:** Basically, it increases your FPS without losing quality hence it even increases graphics quality. 

The idea is make games render at 1080p and make it look like they are running at 4k. 

DLSS forces the game to render at a lower resolution and then uses its trained A.I. Algorithm to infer what it would look like if it were rendered at a higher one (typically 4k)

These takes advantage of the [[GPU Cores#Tensor Cores|Tensor Cores]] design in mind which supports deep learning.
