DNS is a **way for us to ==communicate with devices on the internet== without remembering complex numbers.** 
When visiting a website, **it's unconvenient to remember `104.26.10.299` thus we remember `tryhackme.com` instead** and DNS allows us to do that. 



**DNSÂ isn't just for websites though, and ==multiple types of DNS record exist**==. 
These are the common one
- A Record - for IPv4 Addresses
- AAAA Record - for IPv6 Addresses
[[More DNS Record Types]]


DNS records all come with a **TTL (Time To Live) value. ==Time value represented in seconds that should be saved for locally== until you have to look it up again**. Caching saves on having to make a DNS request every time you communicate with a server.
