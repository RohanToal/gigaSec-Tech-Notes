A database is a way of electronically storing collections of data in an organised manner. 

A database is controlled by a 
**DBMS - Database Management System**, 
- Relational DBMS
- Non-Relational DBMS 

**Relational DBMS**Â  
Stores information in tables  
-> MySQL, 
-> Microsoft SQL Server, Access, 
-> PostgreSQL 
-> SQLite. 

**Non-relational DBMS** sometimes called **NoSQL**  
Desn't use tables, columns and rows to store the data
-> MongoDB, 
-> Cassandra 
-> ElasticSearch.


Within a DBMS, you can have multiple databases, each containing its own set of related data.
