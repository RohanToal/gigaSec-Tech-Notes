[[i3 Tiling Manager]]

rofi setup  
Use `rofi -show drun` 
because `rofi -show run` shows useless commands and sometimes apps installed aren't shown as well


There are many things to consider when setting up i3
1. the application launcher
-> rofi, drun etc..

2. The status bar
-> polybar, **bumblebee**
[[Bumblebee Status Bar]]


3. The fonts
-> Fonts to show icons

4. The shell
-> ZSH

5. The terminal
-> Gnome Terminal, 

6. i3 gaps
