**Sway**
Disable Clipboard History 
`/etc/sway/config.d/99-autostart-applications.conf`

**[[i3]]**

rofi setup  
Use `rofi -show drun` 
because `rofi -show run` shows useless commands and sometimes apps installed aren't shown as well


There are many things to consider when setting up i3
1. the application launcher
-> rofi, drun etc..

2. The status bar
-> polybar, **bumblebee**

3. The fonts
-> Fonts to show icons

4. The shell
-> ZSH

5. The terminal
-> Gnome Terminal,
