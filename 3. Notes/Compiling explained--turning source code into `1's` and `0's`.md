The process of turning source code into `1's` and `0's` (binary)

**Preprocessing** = turns the headers into codes. Replaces the header with its own code.

**Compiling** = turns the code into assembly languange. 

**Assembling** = turns the assembly languange into binary/machine code. 

**Linking** = The translation between my own code and each of the headers code to binary happens distinctly.  In C, there could be at least two sets of binary. One is my own source code, the other is the header code ``<#include stdio.h>`` . Linking basically combines all this binary code into a one single file.
