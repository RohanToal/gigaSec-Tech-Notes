Inside `<a>` element
and using `href` attribute, which means `hyperlink reference` or `target`

### More attributes for `<a>`

`title="This will only show up on hover of the link"`
**Note:** A link `title` is only revealed on mouse hover, people relying on keyboard controls/touchscreens to navigate web pages will have difficulty accessing `<title>` info. 
If a title's information is truly important to the usability of the page,
Then you should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users, 
    for example by putting it in the regular text.

`href="mailto:example@yahoo.com"`

You can provide more info to `mailto`
In fact, any standard mail header fields can be added to the `mailto` URL you provide. 
The most commonly used of these are 
-> "subject", 
-> "cc", and 
-> "body" (which is not a true header field, but allows you to specify a short content message for the new email). 
Each field and its value is specified as a **query term**.
