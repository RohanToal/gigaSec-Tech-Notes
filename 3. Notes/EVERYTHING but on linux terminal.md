### Finding a File Containing a Particular Text String In Linux
Finding and locating files can be done with `find` command. 
Unfortunately, `find` command cannot look inside a text file for a string.

You need to use the grep command. The grep command or egrep command searches the given input FILEs for lines containing a match or a text string.
[[GREP - uses regex to search texts in linux files]]
