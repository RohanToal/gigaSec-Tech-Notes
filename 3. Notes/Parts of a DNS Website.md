**TLD (Top-Level Domain)**
The `tryhackme.com` the TLD is `.com`. 

Two types of TLD
gTLD (Generic Top Level) 
- was meant to tell the user the domain name's purpose; for example, a ==.com would be for commercial purposes**==, .org for an organisation.

ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain). 
- was used for location like `.ca` for sites based in Canada.



**Second-Level Domain**
Taking `tryhackme.com` as an example, `tryhackme` is the Second Level Domain. 



**Subdomain**  
It's on the left-hand side of Second-Level Domain. For example, in the name `admin.tryhackme.com` the `admin` part is the subdomain. 

Multiple subdomains is possible such as `jupiter.servers`  in `jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com`.
