Hacking requires a _vast_ knowledge base -- because how are you supposed to break into something if you don't know how it works?

The thing is: no one knows everything. Everyone (professional or amateur, experienced or totally new to the subject) will encounter problems which they don't automatically know how to solve. This is where research comes in, as, in the real world, you can't ever expect to simply be handed the answers to your questions.

In the field of information security, there will never come a point where you don't need to look things up.



Steganoraphy - is the act of hiding hidden message or file inside of another file. 

Start with a question; get an initial understanding of the topic; then look into more advanced aspects as needed. The expectation will be,  you start from nothing and as you slowly answer a broad question, you get to ask more specific questions and answer those, with the hope of building a complete picture of understanding.
