Hacking requires a _vast_ knowledge base because how are you supposed to break into something if you don't know how it works? 


In the field of information security, 
there will never come a point where you don't need to look things up.

The thing is: no one knows everything. 
Everyone (professional, experienced or totally new) 
will encounter problems which they don't automatically know how to solve. 

### This is where research comes in 
In the real world, 
you can't ever expect to simply be handed the answers to your questions.



### How to do research
Start with a question; get an initial understanding of the topic; then look into more advanced aspects as needed. The expectation will be,  you start from nothing and as you slowly answer a broad question, you get to ask more specific questions and answer those, with the hope of building a complete picture of understanding. 


Blogs are valuable for learning when it comes to information security, 
as many security researchers keep a blog.


### Website for CVE 
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search
NVD keeps tracks of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER


### Website for Out of the Box Exploits
https://www.exploit-db.com
Tends to be very useful for hackers, as it often actually contains exploits that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. It tends to be one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest.

If you're inclined towards the CLI on Linux, Kali comes pre-installed with a tool called "searchsploit" which allows you to search ExploitDB from your own machine. This is offline, and works using a downloaded version of the database, meaning that you already have all of the exploits already on your Kali Linux!
