In the field of information security, 
There will never come a point where you don't need to look things up.

**The thing is: no one knows everything.** 
Everyone (professional, experienced or totally new) 
will encounter problems which they don't automatically know how to solve. 
### This is where research comes in 
In the real world, 
you can't ever expect to simply be handed the answers to your questions.


### How to do research
Start with a question; 
get an initial understanding of the topic; 
then look into more advanced aspects as needed. 

The expectation will be,  you start from nothing and as you slowly answer a broad question, you get to ask more specific questions and answer those, with the hope of building a complete picture of understanding. 





### Website for CVE 
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search
CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER


### Website for Out of the Box Exploits
https://www.exploit-db.com
Contains exploits that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. 
It tends to be one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest.

**CLI on Linux** for `exploit-db.com`
Kali comes with "searchsploit" 
which allows you to search ExploitDB from your own machine. 
This is offline, and works using a downloaded version of the database.
