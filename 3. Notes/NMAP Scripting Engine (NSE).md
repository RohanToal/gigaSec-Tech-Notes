## Multiple Scripts can be run in single command
We use `,` to separate commands
#### `--script=<script_name1>, <script_name2>`
```Lua
--script=smb-enum-users, smb-enum-shares
```

## Built-in help of scripts
#### `nmap --script-help <script-name>``
It will have a website link that leads you to more info


## Arguments in scripts
#### `<script-name>.<argument>`


## Finding nmap scripts
### Through the official website
https://nmap.org/nsedoc/



### Or the local copy
#### `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`
^ Directory above contains `script.db`

---> You could grep `script.db`
`grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`
`grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`

---> Or search the folder with this syntax
`ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*script_name*`
