Multiple Scripts can be run, by separating commas
Here we are running two scripts
`smb-enum-users`
`smb-enum-shares`
```Lua
--script=smb-enum-users, smb-enum-shares
```

Nmap scripts come with built-in help
`nmap --script-help <script-name>``
The built-in help will have a website that will lead you to more info such as arguments for the script


Some scripts require arguments
`<script-name>.<argument>`


Finding nmap scripts

Or the local copy
`/usr/share/nmap/scripts`
All scripts are installed here by default

Inside of the folder contains 
This is where nmap keep tracks of the script

`grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`


Or this search
`ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*`
