#### Abstract:


---
- Poorly configured permissions on cloud services
- Having unnecessary features enabled (services, pages, accounts or priveleges)
- Default accounts with unchanged passwords
- Overly Detailed Error Messages (allows attacker to find out more about system)
- NOT using HTTP Security Headers 
- Revealing too much detail in Server:HTTP Header

The Mirari Malware was able to take offline a DNS provider
because it used DEFAULT PASSWORDS
