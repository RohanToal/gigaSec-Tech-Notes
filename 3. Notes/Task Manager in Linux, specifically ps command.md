`ps`, provides list of running processes
`ps aux`, ALL users running processes

`top`, to view info in real time. Updates 10 seconds and will also update each time you move cursor through arrow keys


Foregrounding and Backgrounding a process
For instance, you are loop printing "Hello World" and you want to start using the command line. You don't have to open a new terminal just to leave that loop printing in background. You can just do `ctrl+z`, rest assured when you use `ps`, the process will still be there.  
`fg` is used to make the background process into foreground.
