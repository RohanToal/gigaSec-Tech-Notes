## How Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Work?
Goal: 
- Alice and Bob want to talk securely
- They want to establish common key

Why:
- so that they can use SYMmetric cryptography, [[SYMmetric Encryption]]

Problem:
- BUT, they don't want to use Key Exchange, [[Key Exchange explained]]

Solution:
- DH Key Exchange

Often used alongside RSA public key cryptography
- to prove the identity of the person you're talking to with digital signing
- This prevents someone from attacking the connection with a man in the middle attack by pretending to be Bob.
