#### Abstract:

### Plans on how to read the book
- Everytime you read a new chapter
    -> Read the Preface part first in pg 13 or XI

### Conventions used on the book
_Italic_
-> New terms, URLS, email, 
-> filenames AND file extensions

C o n s t a n t    W i d t h
-> program listings
-> within paragraphs that refer to program elements
    -> such as variable/function, databases, data types, statements and keywords

**C o n s t a n t    W i d t h   b o l d**
-> Should be typed by user

*C o n s t a n t    W i d t h   b o l d*
-> text that should be replaced w/ user input or values by context



## Let's start!

Pointers can be difficult to master

**Stack** is used to support functions
**Heap** is used to support dynamic memory allocation

Understanding stack frames helps clarifies concepts 
- passing by value
- passing by pointer
- how recursion works


Key to understand pointers
- Understand how memory is managed in C
After all, pointers contain the address of memory. If we don't understand how memory is organized/managed, it's difficult to understand how pointers work.
