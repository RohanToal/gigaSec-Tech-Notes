My own understanding: 
**Allocating memory means ==finding an empty spaced address==** to be used as a storage. Kind of like finding an appropriate size of galloon to store water in a mall but malloc here already does that for us, we just receive our own appropriate size of gallon.

This empty address has no values assigned to it or better, there are only garbage values on it.
