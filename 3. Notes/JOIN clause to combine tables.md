==**Combines two or more than that, separate tables into one temporary table**== 

Real world data is often 
    -> broken down into pieces stored across multiple tables.
    -> It's a process known as normalization, [[Database Normalization explained]]


**Primary Key**
Sharing tables must have primary key that identifies an info uniquely across the database. 
Primary key type examples 
-> auto-incrementing integer (which is space efficient), 
-> but can be a string, 
-> a hashed value, 
-> The important trait of primary key is it's unique
