[[PC - GPU]]

### Architecture
- The platform (or technology) that the GPU is based upon. This is generally improved by companies over card generations. An example would be AMD's Polaris architecture.

### Memory Bandwidth
- Determines how efficiently the GPU can utilize the available VRAM
	
### Texture Fillrate
- It's the number of pixels that can be textured per second.

### Cores/Processors
- Such as NVIDIA CUDA Â® Cores 
- CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture )

### SLI/Crossfire
- Basically using 2 or more graphics card at the same time. 
- Need more power? Why not throw in 2 compatible gpu's and bridge them to render even more pixels?
