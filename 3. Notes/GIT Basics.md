Create a new repository
`git init`

"Working Directory"     which holds the actual files
"Index"                          is the staging area
"HEAD"                         points to the last commit you've made

From "Working Directory" to "Index"
`git add <filename>`
`git add *`

"Index" to "HEAD"
`git commit -m "Commit Message"`


For GUI Access
`gitk`
