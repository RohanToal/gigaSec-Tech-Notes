[[Questions to ask when solving a problem]]

---
Wasting Time on Problems: 
Yes, I must say it is a waste of time if you are giving more than one hour to a medium level problem. It is OK for a beginner to see the solution and learn from it. And try to remember the approach.

Learning language syntax only teaches you how to write - 
it's like grammar. It doesn't teach you what to write, or why.

### When you look up the solution 
-> don't think that you solved the problem without understanding it and move on.
-> don't just read it, say “yeah, whatever” in your mind and skip.

Think about the problems but most importantly we want to get value from it. 
- Ask yourself, “why couldn’t I solve it? How could I have solved this?”
- Maybe it’s lack of knowledge (e.g. you do not understand how the law of Mechanics works). If it’s knowledge, don’t problem-solve, but learn theory first.
- Maybe you had to think out of the box. Learn from this experience. Note this down in your mind.

On and on, you do this, and your problem solving would increase. And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.

EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.
Nobody is born solving complex problems. Like any skill, problem-solving is developed.

### Mindset when dealing with errors (logical error, bug etc..)
Instead of thinking like "arguing with a petty opponent" 
I would say to me it's more like physics 
- where there are rules that can bend but not break 
- and you have to figure out how to do it within those constrains 
- and when you do, it's pure just bliss.

Many think that becoming a better problem solver means beign able to solve more problems faster
But no, it's about being able to find the best solutiont o aproblem and then put that solution in place.


Programmers first understand how a human solves the problem.
Then understand how to translate that into an algorithm that a computer can do
And finally, how to write the specific syntax (or the languange we communicate to the computer)

Encapsulation and Abstraction
For example, if the professor asks you to "Get me a cup of coffee"
We as humans uses encapsulation to instantly know how to do the steps.
However, the actual real number of steps to get the coffee are
- getting up, walking down the hall, getting in your car
- driving to a coffee stand, paying for the coffee, 
- getting the change if there is a change etc.. etc.. 

Then we do an [[Abstraction in programming]] to ignore small unimportant details and only remember few important items
However, if we take a way the abstraction, which computers do
They will ask for 
- Will it be a mug of coffee or in a styrofoam one?
- Freshly Brewed, or concentrated?
- Does it come from Africa or America?
- and more seemingly unimportant questions

It's basically like this, 
Doing programming is basically
thinking about the problem and solve it in an elegant manner
or
you could just lazily program and debug all the way.

1. Understand the Problem
You solve problems with a good problem approach strategy 
- by analyzing, studying, and planning solutions, sometimes multiple ones. 
- It may take time and requires patience. So let’s break it down.

A problem may appear to be complex if you don't understand all the details.

Once you have the details and understand the problem it is time to plan a solution.
2. Then, plan a solution
analyze the constraints and the rules, s
strategize a step-by-step solution and 
come up with testing data or hypotheses to test against it.

The idea that spending time on a plan that may be scratched later may seem like a waste of time, 
but the simple step of planning for something gives you the idea of the whole thing and makes it much easier to adapt on the fly later on.

It is impossible to predict the whole outcome in one plan and that's why plans may change or get abandoned as soon as you work on implementing them.


3.  Start with what you know
If planed correctly, you should be able to identify many parts of the problem and it is always best to solve for the things you are familiar with first.


4.  Divide the problem
divide your problems into chunks, solve all the chunks then solve the whole thing.

5. Simplify the problem
Simplifying means changing the constraints or rules. In the tech world, it is often referred to as finding the MVP solution. You pretty much reduce the scope of the problem to make the problem simpler. Once you have a solution for the simpler version of the problem, it provides us with enough knowledge, experience, and research time to solve the bigger version of it later.


6. **Backup and state the problem**
Sometimes, even when you collect all details, plan, and chunk the problem you cannot reach a solution. If you feel you are getting frustrated it is best to back up, calm down and re-state the problem. You should never spin your wheels on something that is affecting your mood.

Once you get frustrated you tend to complicate things, fail or pick a complex solution for the problem. Walk away for the day or for hours, take a deep breath and explain the problem back to you out loud. Sketch what is going on to check your understanding of the problem. 
Solving problems should be a logical thing and not an emotional one.



We only want to code when we've thought about how we're gonna approach/solve the problem





Worst thing you could do is
-> immediately start coding after you're presented with a problem

> I would spend the first 45 minutes shapening my axe

A good way to significantly improve your ability to solve problems
-> Solving code problems 
-> Exposing yourself on different types of problems

15-30 Minutes a day is already good


To solve problems you need to slow down and gain control over the anxiety to reach the solution quickly.
