[[Questions to ask when solving a problem]]

1. Understand the Problem
You solve problems with a good problem approach strategy 
- by analyzing, studying, and planning solutions, sometimes multiple ones. 
- It may take time and requires patience. So letâ€™s break it down.

A problem may appear to be complex if you don't understand all the details.

Once you have the details and understand the problem it is time to plan a solution.
2. Then, plan a solution
analyze the constraints and the rules, s
strategize a step-by-step solution and 
come up with testing data or hypotheses to test against it.

The idea that spending time on a plan that may be scratched later may seem like a waste of time, 
but the simple step of planning for something gives you the idea of the whole thing and makes it much easier to adapt on the fly later on.

It is impossible to predict the whole outcome in one plan and that's why plans may change or get abandoned as soon as you work on implementing them.


3.  Start with what you know
If planed correctly, you should be able to identify many parts of the problem and it is always best to solve for the things you are familiar with first.


4.  Divide the problem
divide your problems into chunks, solve all the chunks then solve the whole thing.

5. Simplify the problem
Simplifying means changing the constraints or rules. In the tech world, it is often referred to as finding the MVP solution. You pretty much reduce the scope of the problem to make the problem simpler. Once you have a solution for the simpler version of the problem, it provides us with enough knowledge, experience, and research time to solve the bigger version of it later.


6. **Backup and state the problem**
Sometimes, even when you collect all details, plan, and chunk the problem you cannot reach a solution. If you feel you are getting frustrated it is best to back up, calm down and re-state the problem. You should never spin your wheels on something that is affecting your mood.

Once you get frustrated you tend to complicate things, fail or pick a complex solution for the problem. Walk away for the day or for hours, take a deep breath and explain the problem back to you out loud. Sketch what is going on to check your understanding of the problem. 
Solving problems should be a logical thing and not an emotional one.



We only want to code when we've thought about how we're gonna approach/solve the problem





Worst thing you could do is
-> immediately start coding after you're presented with a problem

A good way to significantly improve your ability to solve problems
-> Solving code problems 
-> Exposing yourself on different types of problems

15-30 Minutes a day is already good


To solve problems you need to slow down and gain control over the anxiety to reach the solution quickly.
