Abstract:

The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible

Usually this will be a website on the internet, but it could also be for a computer on your home network if you want to check if it's configured correctly.

Ping works using the ICMP protocol, which is one of the slightly less well-known TCP/IP protocols that were mentioned earlier.

The ICMP protocol works on the Network layer of the OSI Model, and thus the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.


The basic syntax for ping isÂ `ping <target>` like `ping google.com`

This is a handy secondary application for ping, as it can be used to determine the IP address of the server hosting a website
