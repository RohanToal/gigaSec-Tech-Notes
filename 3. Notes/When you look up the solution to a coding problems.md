## When you look up the solutions
**==DON'T==**
-> don't think that you solved the problem without understanding it and move on.
-> don't just read it, say “yeah, whatever” in your mind and skip.

Think about the problems 
because we want to get value from pre-made solutions 
- Ask yourself, **==“why couldn’t I solve it? How could I have solved this?”==**
     - Maybe it’s lack of knowledge (e.g. you do not understand how the law of Mechanics works). If knowledge is lacking, don’t problem-solve, but learn theory first.
    - Maybe you had to think out of the box. Learn from this experience. Note this down in your mind.

On and on, you do this, and your problem solving would increase. 
And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.

EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.
Nobody is born solving complex problems. Like any skill, problem-solving is developed.
