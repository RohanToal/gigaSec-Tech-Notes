Layers `7, 6, 5`, 
Data is referred to as **==data==**. 

[[4 - Transport Layer]] 
Data is referred to as a **==segment or a datagram==**. 


[[3 - Network Layer]] 
Data is referred to as a **==packet==**. 


[[2 - Data Link Layer]]
Data is referred to as **==frame==**

[[1 - Physical Layer]]
Data is now referred to as **==bits==**



Now, that data has been broken down to `bits` 
It is now ready for transmission
