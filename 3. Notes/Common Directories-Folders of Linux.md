[[Root Directory is the GOD of all folders]]



[[Root Directory and the peasant folders it reigns over explained]]


We have two types of path 
1) Absolute path, 
    It start with root directory (/) and follows the tree branch untill path of desired directory or file completed. Ex. cd /home/me/practice
2) Relative path 
    It start from working directory to do this we use some symbols like . (dot) which refers current working directory and .. (dot dot ) which refers parent directory of current working directory
