"Bad programming is easy. _Idiots_ can learn it in _21 days_, even if they are _dummies_."


Let's analyze the title with "Teach yourself C++ in 24 hours"

- In 24 hours, there's clearly not enough time to write hundreds of codes, learn from its succesess and failures. 
- you might be able to learn some of the syntax of C++ (you know another language), but you couldn't learn what C++ is actually good (and bad) for.


Teach yourself programming in TEN YEARS

Work on **projects with** other programmers. 
-> Be the best programmer on some projects;
    When you're the best, you get to test your abilities to lead a project, and to inspire others with your vision. 

-> Be the worst on somes
    When you're the worst, you learn what the masters do, 
    you learn what they don't like to do (because they make you do it for them).


Work on **projects _after_** other programmers. 
Understand a program written by someone else. 
See what it takes to understand and fix it when the original programmers are not around. 
Think about how to design your programs to make it easier for those who will maintain them after you.
