Uses social engineering 
Convinces *sim carrier* to reset/activate victim's sim card to hacker's phone.

-> Any calls/texts will no longer be received to victim's sim 
-> Instead be received to the hackers sim.

### Why Swim Swap is dangerous
2fa sometimes relies on txt codes 
hackers can use this method to login to your sensitive accounts.



### How Swim Swap works
They gather as much as information about you.
They buy info on dark web, social media details or phishing emails.

Purpose is to 
convince the phone carrier that it's you and not an impersonator. 



### How to protect yourself:
Donâ€™t rely on phone number for authentication. 
This includes text messaging (SMS), which is not encrypted.
