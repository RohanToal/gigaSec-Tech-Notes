Uses social engineering convincing the sim phone carrier to reset or activate their sim card onto a new phone.

Basically, any calls or texts will no longer be received to your sim but instead to the hackers sim. 

This is dangerous as 2fa sometimes relies on txt codes and potentially, hackers can use that to login in your bank accounts or other sensitive accounts.


How it works
1. They gather as much as information to you so that they convince the phone carrier that it's you and not an impersonator. They do this by buying info on dark web, using social media or phishing emails.


How to protect yourself:
1. Donâ€™t build your security and identity authentication solely around your phone number. This includes text messaging (SMS), which is not encrypted.
