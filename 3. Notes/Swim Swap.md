### How Swim Swap works
They gather as much as information about you.
They buy info on dark web, social media details or phishing emails.

convince the phone carrier that it's you and not an impersonator. 



### How to protect yourself:
Donâ€™t rely on phone number for authentication. 
This includes text messaging (SMS), which is not encrypted.
