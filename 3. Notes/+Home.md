### Process of Note Taking
Fleeting
- This is where I type the snippets I find interesting from articles/videos. 
- Then I read the notes to make sense of it. I remove what that doesn't make sense. 
- ~~Whenever, I copy paste snippets, I just straight up paste them in the note. I don't categorize them yet until I read them again on the note.~~ Due to me typing instead of copy pasting, I can already formulate a categorization.


Literature
- This is sometimes a note that leads to every permanent note that I've created.
- Sometimes, it's just the neater version of fleeting note
- Sometimes, when there is just a bunch of information in a single note. 


Cleaning Up
- This is where I remove redundant words of notes. The goal here is to make the sentence have less words as much as possible.
- This is also most of decisions come on how to make my notes neat and readable.
- Also where I frequently change title to notes. The goal is make it possible for me to understood what the note contains just from reading the title
- This also makes it possible for me to make permanent notes. But that isn't the priority here, instead we prioritize making notes that is understandable and actually make sense.

It's important to me that my system is not rigid and allows flexibility. What those process only mean above is that's how usually happens whenever I take notes. I didn't create this rules before I started writing notes. It only happened when I already created a bunch of notes. This approach is called bottom-up, where we started from nothing and slowly we build notes. When we have enough notes, then that's where we end up categorizing our notes or make rules. Using our previous behaviors we did when taking notes as a decision factor of creating the flexible rules.

This is not a one way note taking approach where I MUST follow these order every time I create a note. I allow my system to stop on fleeting note, then make another new note if I want to. Then probably, weeks later I stumbled by accident that fleeting note and make it into literature, or probably not. 


Problems 
- ~~Currently it takes time to organize informatio My system isn't suitable for amassing lots of info in a short period of time whislt being understandable.~~ 
- **Update: It's possible now thanks to me typing instead of copy pasting words**
- ~~Abstract section seems a bit weak. 


Abstract section
Purpose
- give a glance of what the note is all about. 
- I also put the links of the permanent notes there. 
How does it do it?
- I put the most important headers on their.
- I sometimes summarize the key ideas there. 



Maybe not that good?
- ~~I've kind of experience ridigity where I am afraid to touch permanent notes because I might break its readability or its understandability. But it could be solved by transforming the note into fleeting, and opportunistically make the note permanent. Also perhaps put the new info at the bottom of the note. 
- **Update: Nahh it's alright, the permanent notes I've touched and edited so far allowed flexibility/**


Good
- I can be confident that whatever information I stored here can easily be retrieved and understood
- Whatever information that I store in here can be useful in their own way. Notes are permanently stored and never get thrown away unless if I intentionally do it so


Changes
- I might stop copy pasting but instead type everything. As I can easily control what info will stay and not. With, copy pasting, I sometimes just copy paste straight and not read the whole info thereby increasing the time of rereading the text again.
- I think it's better for me to read the whole paragraph or article before I start writing words.
**Update: Changes did work**
    - Awesome, I spent less time rereading the note for trimming down the details. When writing it by myself, I understood the text better as naturally, you're gonna read it slowly. Then I can also spent time cutting down unnecessary details to reduce the words.

It's been some time since I've transformed a note into literature or permanent. I have been stuffing in lots of information. Tho it's not becoming troublesome or a hindrance to my workflow. It's just that I have not been following the principle of fleeting, literature and permanent thing in my system. Like I said, not a bother, just a notice of my workflow.

A problem
It's making me having a decision freeze where I have to think about where I'll put what I learned in linux during my browsing time or whenever I'm fixing whatever broke in linux.

A solution
We could make a note specifically dedicated to the things I learned. No matter what category it is, it will be there.
However, I am assigning responsibility to my future self to read and categorize my notes there. Therefore I am creating a time debt to my future self. 
-> So probably make it easier for my future self, that would be assining some keywords like linux, ssh, shell, or etc... depending on the topic. Then whenever i get back reading that note, I can have an ease decision of where I'll put the note. 


Okay so how are we going to go with having a note with all the quick knowledege learn
