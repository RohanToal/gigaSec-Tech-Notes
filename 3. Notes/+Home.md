### Process of Note Taking
Fleeting
- This is where I frequently copy, paste the snippets from articles/videos. 
- Then I read the copy pasted notes to make sense of the notes. I remove what that doesn't make sense. 
- Whenever, I copy paste snippets, I just straight up paste them in the note. I don't categorize them yet until I read them again on the note. 
- Sometimes, categorization happens here but it's not the priority. The priority is reading the note again.

Literature
- This is sometimes a note that leads to every permanent note that I've created.
- Sometimes, it's just the neater version of fleeting note
- Sometimes, when there is just a bunch of information in a single note. 


Cleaning Up
- This is where I remove redundant words of notes. The goal here is to make the sentence have less words as much as possible.
- This is also most of decisions come on how to make my notes neat and readable.
- Also where I frequently change title to notes. The goal is make it possible for me to understood what the note contains just from reading the title
- This also makes it possible for me to make permanent notes. But that isn't the priority here, instead we prioritize making notes that is understandable and actually make sense.

It's important to me that my system is not rigid and allows flexibility. What those process only mean above is that's how usually happens whenever I take notes. I didn't create this rules before I started writing notes. It only happened when I already created a bunch of notes. This approach is called bottom-up, where we started from nothing and slowly we build notes. When we have enough notes, then that's where we end up categorizing our notes or make rules. Using our previous behaviors we did when taking notes as a decision factor of creating the flexible rules.

This is not a one way note taking approach where I MUST follow these order every time I create a note. I allow my system to stop on fleeting note, then make another new note if I want to. Then probably, weeks later I stumbled by accident that fleeting note and make it into literature, or probably not.
