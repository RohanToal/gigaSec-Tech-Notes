### Process of Note Taking
Fleeting
- This is where I frequently copy, paste snippets from articles/videos. 
- Then I read the copy pasted notes to make sense of what I read. I remove what that doesn't make sense. 
- Whenever, I copy paste snippets, I just straight up paste them in the note. I don't categorize them yet until I read them again on the note. 
- Sometimes, categorization happens here but it's not the priority. The priority is reading the note again.

Literature
- This is sometimes a page that leads to every permanent note that I've created.
- Sometimes, it's just the neater version of fleeting note
- Sometimes, when there is just a bunch of information in a single note. 


Cleaning Up
- This is where I remove redundant words of notes. The goal here is to make the sentence have less words as much as possible.
- This is also where I decide how to make my notes neat and readable.
- Also where I frequently change title to notes. The goal is make it possible for me to understood what the note contains just from reading the title
- This also makes it possible for me to make permanent notes. But that isn't the priority here, instead we prioritize making notes that is understandable and actually make sense.

It's important to me that this process is not rigid and allows flexibility. What those only mean above is that's how usually happens whenever I take notes. I didn't create this rules before I started writing notes. It only happened when I already created a bunch of notes. This approach is called bottom-up, where we started from nothing and slowly we build notes, when we have enough notes, then that's where we end up making rules or categorising the notes.
