### Process of Note Taking
Fleeting
- This is where I frequently copy, paste snippets from articles/videos. 
- Then I read the copy pasted notes to make sense of what I read. I remove what that doesn't make sense. 
- Whenever, I copy paste snippets, I just straight up paste them in the note. I don't categorize them yet until I read them again on the note. 
- Sometimes, categorization happens here but it's not the priority. The priority is reading the note again.


Cleaning Up
- This is where I remove redundant words of notes. The goal here is to make the sentence have less words as much as possible.
- This is also where I decide how to make my notes neat and readable.
- Also where I frequently change title to notes. The goal is make it possible for me to understood what the note contains just from reading the title
