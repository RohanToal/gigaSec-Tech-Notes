Lets programmers deconstruct their software into its constituent parts for the purpose of finding bugs, and thus de-bugging. 
- Additionally debuggers can be used for reverse-engineering, to see what is inside the software, to learn its logic. 


Method is used mostly by malware researchers. 

Can be also used by an attacker to "crack" softwares 
or to alter normal behavior of software, like injecting a malicious code into it.

Debuggers can be used for [[reverse-engineering]]
