And, for the companies who do say they allow responsible bug reporting, here a couple tips for your submissions from a guy who reads a lot of vuln submissions:
-   Don’t make any mention of reward until you’ve established rapport with them. Better yet, wait for them to bring it up.
-   Give them enough clear detail to be able to recreate the problem themselves.
-   Recognize they determine the severity, not you.
-   Recognize that many companies—especially big companies—are painfully slow. Whatever you think is a reasonable response time is probably way faster than they can do. Response times tend to be in days or weeks. Don’t be a pest.
