Can be overwritten in the project settings.
Acts like a default setting for every project


4 main sub-sections of the User options tab:  
-   **Connections** control how Burp makes connections to targets. For example, we can set a proxy for Burp Suite to connect through; this is very useful if we want to use Burp Suite through a network pivot.
-   **TLS** enable and disable various TLS (**T**ransport **L**ayer **S**ecurity) options. Also giving us place to upload client certificates should a web app require us to use one for connections.
-  **Display** change how Burp Suite looks. Also ==configuring options with the rendering engine in Repeater== 
-  **Misc** keybinding table (HotKeys), which allowing us to view and alter the keyboard shortcuts used by Burp Suite. Familiarising yourself with these settings would be advisable, as using the keybinds can speed up your workflow massively.
