### Fragment
![[newurl.png]]
It teleports you to a specific location on the actual page requested. 




Example: Like this long article 
https://leananki.com/zettelkasten-method-smart-notes  
There's a section there called "Tools for the Zettelkasten" but it's a long ass article and I dont want to scroll. 

Luckily, there's a content that directs you through each heading. When you click it, it automatically adds the `fragment`. The newly added fragment is `/#Tools_for_the_Zettelkasten_Method`.

New link with `fragment`: https://leananki.com/zettelkasten-method-smart-notes/#Tools_for_the_Zettelkasten_Method
