An endpoint is any device that connects to a computer network. When Bob and Alice talk on the phone, their connection extends from one person to the other, and the "endpoints" of the connection are their respective phones. Similarly, in a network, computerized devices have "conversations" with each other, meaning they pass information back and forth. Just as Bob is one endpoint of his and Alice's conversation, a computer connected to a network is one endpoint of an ongoing data exchange.

Everyday examples of endpoints include 
- desktop, smartphones, tablets, 
- laptops, and [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-of-things-iot/) devices.
