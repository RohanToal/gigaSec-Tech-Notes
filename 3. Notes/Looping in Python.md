alternative for `while loop` that 
- uses length as a condition to end
- this is good for an list that changes its length during runtime
```python
for i in range(len(arr)):
    pass
```

## range() function
`range(start, stop, [step])


Try these:
My prediction is the loop will end until the end of the character or basically the length of the character
```python
variable = "Hello there"
for i in range(variable):
```
