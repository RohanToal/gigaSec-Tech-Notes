Abstract:


---
**Depth-first search (DFS)** is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or  graph data structures. One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
**pre-order** visit, left, right, 
**in-order** left, visit, right, 
**post-order** left, right, visit


**Breadth-first search** is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph structures. In level-order, where we visit every node on a level before going to a lower level.
