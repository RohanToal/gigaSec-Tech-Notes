-> RSA seems to come up relatively often in CTFs
-> normally requiring you to calculate variables 
Wikipedia page for RSA seems complicated at first,
but will give you good info you need  to complete challenges.
or break some encryption based on them.


Key variables for CTF are 
`p    q` 
`m    n` 
`e    d`
`c`
“p” and “q” are large prime numbers, 
“n” is the product of p and q.
`n` and `e` are public key
`n` and `d` are private key
