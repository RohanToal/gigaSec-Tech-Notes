Abstract:


---
Plainly, it just gives you the remainder of the division of two numbers.
```C
7 % 3 =  1
6 % 3 = 0
```


See if it's an even number
`n % 2`
1 means odd
0 means even


Circular Array
`[1, 2, 3, 4]`
Since the array is full, 
I can wrap back at the beginning
and that's where I put the new values `5, 6`
`[5, 6, 3, 4]`
