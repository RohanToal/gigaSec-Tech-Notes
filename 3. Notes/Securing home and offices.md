Infosec professionals are well versed when it comes to digital security and their equipment. Some walk the extra mile and avoid sharing any personal information online. Others, like Smith, only post fake information on their social media profiles. "You need to make sure that you're taking whatever the proper precautions are to protect your house, your family," Liska says.

In addition to online security, infosec professionals also must pay attention to physical security. Smith suggests having several rings of security: fences, walls, strong doors, and even internally lockable doors. "I use locks I can't force/pick, doors I can't bypass, and keys that are hard to copy," he says. "Even if someone can access my keys, the blanks are restricted, so they are harder to copy." Among the locks he recommends are ASSA Twin, EVVA MCS, and Abloy Protec II, which he considers to be the most secure. Still, even these can be beaten. "But if your adversary is capable of opening these without the key, then you are in a lot of trouble," he says.

The door itself needs to be solid, too. It has to have a sturdy frame without gaps at the bottom or round edges to prevent things from getting inside the home. "The hinges on a door are a weak point, so it is best to have them on the inside," Smith adds. The researcher also recommends using an external letterbox instead of a slot for mail embedded in the door because it could give an attacker access to the rear of the door.

In addition to a solid multipoint locking door, homes and offices should also use CCTV. "Make sure it is wired, not wireless, because jamming or just throwing deauth packets at devices can stop them working," Smith says. "The same with alarm systems. Wired, always. Alarm sensors need to be properly installed because many alarm companies leave blind spots."

According to the researcher, the wiring for CCTV and alarms needs to be inaccessible from the outside, and the CCTV recording box should backup everything to the cloud. "If possible, give CCTV access to more than one person, so that there is redundancy in case of an incident," Smith says. The best systems check communications periodically and issue an alarm if comms go down.

A few other things to consider: Pay attention to security lighting, which should be sensor-driven. Use a post-office box so that your address is harder to trace, vary when you leave the house to make your movements less predictable, and be nice to your neighbors so that they will alert you if someone is entering your house.
