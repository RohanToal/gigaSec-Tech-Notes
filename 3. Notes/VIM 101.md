Abstract:
[[Some random long read about VIM I found online]]

---
In nvim
Base configuration is at `~/config/nvim/init.lua`


#### Append (a) 
Append will put cursor AFTER current position

#### Insert (i)
Insert will put cursor BEFORE current position


### Selection
#### Select All
**ggVG**
gg jumps to beginning of file
VG selects it all.



### Deletion
#### Delete (x)
Delete char on current position
-> aasda dasd asd asdasd ad

#### Delete Words 
(dw)
->  hsjdfhsdkf sdasdas
(de)


#### Delete line (shift+d)
Delete from current position to end of line
These doesn't delete whitespaces
-> sdasdasd asdas asdasd adasda asdasd  


#### Delete whole line (dd) 
Including the whitespaces



Many commands that change text 
are made from an OPERATOR and a MOTION 

d = delete OPERATOR
motion = 

#### Motion -> commands that lets you move cursor
w = move cursor at next word then first letter of it
e = move cursor at the last letter
b = for backwards


#### Using count for motion 
count  motion
2w = to move two words foward
3e = to move cursor at end of the word three steps forward
0 = move start of the lien

#### Using count to delete more
d  count  motion
d3w


#### Exiting Vim IGNORES changes 
`:q!`  or `ZZ`

#### Exiting Vim && SAVING CHANGES
`:wq`
