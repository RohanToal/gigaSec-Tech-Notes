[[Accidentally hit Ctrl+Z in Vim]]


In nvim
Base configuration is at `~/config/nvim/init.lua`


## Different Modes in VIM

[[Command Mode keyboard shortcuts - VIM|Command Mode]]
- Where you can run commands

[[Insert Mode]]
- Where you can type texts

Visual Mode
- Selection of texts so that you can only run commands on that selected text



### Format for modying texts
Commands that manipulate text often uses operator and motion
#### `operator motion`
operator = command itself, instructs what to do
motion = moves over text, commands that lets you move cursor

### Cursor Location and File Status
G to move to bottom of file
gg to start of file

Ctrl + G to show the line number 
`<number>`G to jump to that `<number>` line
`45G` jumps cursor to line 45 


`Ctrl + o`
Go to the previous cursor you were before


VERY USEFUL IN CODING
`%`
Matching Parenthesis Searc
Basically, it automatically goes to the (), {} or []

[[Subsitute Command to replace words]]

Execute any external command
`:!` 
Like `:!ls`, basically any commands outside of VIM 


You could also write a new file inside of vim
`:w FILENAME`


`:r` to retrieve the contents of file and paste it into current file
