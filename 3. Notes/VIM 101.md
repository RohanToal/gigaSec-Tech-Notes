Abstract:
[[Some random long read about VIM I found online]]

---
#### Append (a) 
Append will put cursor AFTER current position

#### Insert (i)
Insert will put cursor BEFORE current position


#### Delete (x)
Delete char on current position
-> aasda dasd asd asdasd ad

#### Delete Words 
(dw)
->  hsjdfhsdkf sdasdas
(de)


#### Delete line (shift+d)
Delete from current position to end of line
These doesn't delete whitespaces
-> sdasdasd asdas asdasd adasda asdasd  

#### Select All
**ggVG**
gg jumps to beginning of file
VG selects it all.


#### Delete whole line (dd) 
Including the whitespaces


Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion 
d = delete operator
motion = commands that let's you move the cursor

#### Motion
w = move cursor at next word first letter
e = move cursor at the last letter


#### Using count for motion 
count  motion
2w = to move two words foward
3e = to move cursor at end of the word three steps forward
0 = move start of the lien

#### Using count to delete more
d  count  motion



#### Exiting Vim without saving changes 
`:q!` 

#### Exiting Vim and saving any changes
`:wq`
