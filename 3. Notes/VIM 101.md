[[VIM Configuration]]



## Different Modes in VIM

[[Command Mode keyboard shortcuts - VIM|Command Mode]]
- Where you can run commands

[[Insert Mode]]
- Where you can type texts

Visual Mode
- Selection of texts so that you can only run commands on that selected text



### Format for modying texts
Commands that manipulate text often uses operator and motion
#### `operator motion`
operator = command itself, instructs what to do
motion = moves over text, commands that lets you move cursor





[[Subsitute Command to replace words]]

Execute any external command
`:!` 
Like `:!ls`, basically any commands outside of VIM 


You could also write a new file inside of vim
`:w FILENAME`


`:r` to retrieve the contents of file and paste it into current file


## [[Visual Mode]]
