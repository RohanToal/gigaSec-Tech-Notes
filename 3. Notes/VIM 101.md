Abstract:
[[Some random long read about VIM I found online]]

---
Command Mode
- Where you can run commands

Insert Mode
- Where you can type texts

Visual Mode
- Selection of texts so that you can only run commands on that selected text



In Command Mode
`U` for Undo



`K` to search for documentation to selected word


**Accidentally hit Ctrl+Z?**
It backgrounds the running process. Type 'fg' to bring it back to the foreground. This isn't actually a vim thing, it's a shell thing

In nvim
Base configuration is at `~/config/nvim/init.lua`


#### Append (a) 
Append will put cursor AFTER current position

`A`
Append at the end of the line

`o`
new line below the current line

#### Insert (i)
Insert will put cursor BEFORE current position

`(I)`  
Insert at the beginning of the line

### Selection
#### Select All
**ggVG**
gg jumps to beginning of file
VG selects it all.

`#` to hop in to similar words of the current word the cursor is at
`$` go to end of the line


### Deletion
#### Delete (x)
Delete char on current position
-> aasda dasd asd asdasd ad

#### Delete Word
(dw)
->  hsjdfhsdkf sdasdas

(de)


#### Delete line (shift+d) or (d$)
Delete from current position to end of line
These doesn't delete whitespaces
-> sdasdasd asdas asdasd


#### Delete whole line (dd) 
Including the whitespaces



Many commands that change text 
are made from an OPERATOR and a MOTION 

d = delete OPERATOR
motion = commands that lets you move cursor

#### Motion -> commands that lets you move cursor
w = move cursor to the start of next word
e = move cursor at the last letter/end of the word
b = for backwards


#### Using count for motion 
count  motion
2w = to move two words foward
3e = to move cursor at end of the word three steps forward
0 = move start of the lien

#### Using count to delete more
d  count  motion
d3w


#### Exiting Vim IGNORES changes 
`:q!`  or `ZZ`

#### Exiting Vim && SAVING CHANGES
`:wq`
