#myquestion How to enter visual mode?



[[Accidentally hit Ctrl+Z in Vim]]


In nvim
Base configuration is at `~/config/nvim/init.lua`


## Different Modes in VIM

Command Mode
- Where you can run commands

Insert Mode
- Where you can type texts

Visual Mode
- Selection of texts so that you can only run commands on that selected text



### Format for modying texts
Commands that manipulate text often uses operator and motion
#### `operator motion`
operator = command itself, instructs what to do
motion = moves over text, commands that lets you move cursor



## Command Mode
`u` undo last command
`U` to fix the whole line 
`Ctrl + r` for redo

`K` to search for documentation to selected word

### Motion in command mode.
commands that lets you move cursor
w = move cursor to the start of next word
e = move cursor at the last letter/end of the word
b = for backwards

#### Count for motion 
You can use count for every motions
`[count]  motion`
2w = to move two words foward
0 = move start of the line 
^ = move start of the line


### [[Deletion]]

### Cursor Location and File Status
G to move to bottom of file
gg to start of file

Ctrl + G to show the line number 
`<number>`G to jump to that `<number>` line
`45G` jumps cursor to line 45 


`Ctrl + o`
Go to the previous cursor you were before


VERY USEFUL IN CODING
`%`
Matching Parenthesis Searc
Basically, it automatically goes to the (), {} or []

[[Subsitute Command to replace words]]

Execute any external command
`:!` 
Like `:!ls`, basically any commands outside of VIM 


You could also write a new file inside of vim
`:w FILENAME`


`:r` to retrieve the contents of file and paste it into current file


## Visual Mode
`v` for visual mode, basically selecting text

press `:` in visual mode
then select texts
do `:w NEWFILE` and baam, your selected texts will appear on that NEWFILE
FUYCKINGG COOL







## Command mode to Insert Mode
`r` to replace the character at the cursor

`c` change operator
`c [count] motion`
This command requires motion
`ce` to change all the way to line
Basically, deletes the word and places you into insert mode



#### Insert
Insert will put cursor BEFORE current position

`I`       Insert at the beginning of the line

A       Insert at END of the line

`O`       New line ABOVE current cursor 



#### Append (a) 
Append will put cursor AFTER current position

`A`       Append at the end of the line

`o`       New line BELOW current cursor
