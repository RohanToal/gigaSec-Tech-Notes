[[Questions to ask when solving a problem]]

### Wasting Time on Problems: 
Yes, I must say it is a waste of time if you are giving more than one hour to a medium level problem. It is OK for a beginner to see the solution and learn from it. And try to remember the approach.

**Learning language syntax only teaches you how to write
It's like grammar. It doesn't teach you what to write, or why.**

### When you look up the solution 
-> don't think that you solved the problem without understanding it and move on.
-> don't just read it, say “yeah, whatever” in your mind and skip.

Think about the problems but most importantly we want to get value from it. 
- Ask yourself, “why couldn’t I solve it? How could I have solved this?”
- Maybe it’s lack of knowledge (e.g. you do not understand how the law of Mechanics works). If it’s knowledge, don’t problem-solve, but learn theory first.
- Maybe you had to think out of the box. Learn from this experience. Note this down in your mind.

On and on, you do this, and your problem solving would increase. And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.

EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.
Nobody is born solving complex problems. Like any skill, problem-solving is developed.

### Mindset when dealing with errors (logical error, bug etc..)
Instead of thinking like "arguing with a petty opponent" 
I would say to me it's more like physics 
- where there are rules that can bend but not break 
- and you have to figure out how to do it within those constrains 
- and when you do, it's pure just bliss.

Many think that becoming a better problem solver means beign able to solve more problems faster
But no, it's about being able to find the best solutiont o aproblem and then put that solution in place.

It's basically like this, 
Doing programming is basically
thinking about the problem and solve it in an elegant manner
or
you could just lazily program and debug all the way. 


Solving problems should be a logical thing and not an emotional one.
Once you get frustrated 
Getting frustrated will make you tend to 
-> complicate things, 
-> fail a solution 
-> or pick a complex solution for the problem. 

## In a Nutshell, Problem Solving in Programmig
First -> we understand how a human solves the problem.
Then -> understand how to translate that into an algorithm that a computer can do
Finally -> writing the specific syntax (the languange we communicate to the computer)


### Encapsulation 
IF -> professor instructs a human to "Get me a cup of coffee"
THEN -> humans uses encapsulation to instantly know how to do the steps.
However, the actual real number of steps to get the coffee are
- getting up, walking down the hall, getting in your car, sitting down inside of your car, knowing the instructions to where the coffee stand is, knowing when to start the car, knowing when to stop the car, 
- driving to a coffee stand, paying for the coffee, 
- getting the change if there is a change etc.. etc.. 
- then knowing when we got the coffee, then knowing the route back to the office, then driving their, then going back to your boss office, if boss is not there, then find him, if he is there, then hand the coffee to boss, and so on....

### Abstraction
Continuing the encapsulation of "Get me a cup of coffee"
We then ask for the details of the coffee itself
[[Abstraction in programming]] basically ignores small unimportant details of an object and only remember few important items

However, if we take a way the abstraction, which computers do
Computers will ask for 
- Will it be a mug of coffee or in a styrofoam one?
- Freshly Brewed, or concentrated?
- Does it come from Africa or America?
- and more seemingly unimportant questions

## Problem Solving for Programmers 
### 1. Understand the Problem
IF -> you don't understand all the details.
THEN -> a problem can appear complex

A good problem approach strategy 
- by analyzing, studying, and planning solutions 
- Can take time and requires patience.
    - So break the problem down into small pieces

### 2. Plan a solution
Once you have details and understand the problem, its time for solution
-> analyze the constraints and rules
-> strategize a step-by-step solution and 
-> come up with testing data or hypotheses to test against it.

As soon as you work on implementing solutions.
-> Plans will change or get abandoned
        because ONE plan isn't enough to predict the whole outcome
    
This may seem like a waste of time
        Spending time on a plan that may be scratched later  
but simple step of planning gives you the idea of the problem 
    making it easier to adapt on the fly later on.


#### Start with what you know
If planed correctly, you should be able to identify many parts of the problem
it is always best to solve for the things you are familiar with first.

#### Divide the problem
divide your problems into chunks, solve all the chunks then solve the whole thing.

#### Simplify the problem
MVP (Mininum Viable Product)

Simplifying means changing the constraints or rules. 
You reduce the scope of the problem to make the problem simpler.
Once you have a solution for the simpler version of the problem, 
-> Will provide us with enough knowledge, experience, and research time to solve the bigger version of it later.

#### Getting Frustrated - I still can't solve the problem!!!
Sometimes, even when you collect all details, plan, and chunk the problem you cannot reach a solution. If you feel you are getting frustrated it is best to back up, calm down and re-state the problem. You should never spin your wheels on something that is affecting your mood.

Once you get frustrated 
Getting frustrated will make you tend to 
-> complicate things, 
-> fail a solution 
-> or pick a complex solution for the problem. 

Walk away for the day or for hours, take a deep breath and explain the problem back to you out loud. Sketch what is going on to check your understanding of the problem. 

Solving problems should be a logical thing and not an emotional one.
