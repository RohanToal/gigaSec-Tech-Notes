[[Cybersecurity Lingo]]

### Payload
An [[Exploit]] will take advantage of a vulnerability. 

**However, if we want the exploit to have the exact result that we want** 
(gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), 
We need to use a payload. 

Payloads are a piece of code that runs on the target system.
