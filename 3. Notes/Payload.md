### What is a Payload
An [[Exploit]] will take advantage of a vulnerability. 

**However, if we want the exploit to have the exact result that we want** 
(gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), 
We need to use a payload. 

Payloads are a piece of code that runs on the target system.

### Examples of a Payload would be; 
-> getting a shell, 
-> loading a malware or backdoor to the target system, 
-> running a command, 


Metasploit has ability to send different payloads...
...that can open shells on the target system.
