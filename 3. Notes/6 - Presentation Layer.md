### Layer 6 - Presentation
Data received from application layer tends to be in a format that the application understands, but it's not necessarily in a standardised format that could be understood by the application layer in the _receiving_ computer. 

The presentation layer **==translates the data into a standardised format==**, as well as **handling any encryption, compression** or other transformations to the data.



When data is correctly formated by presentation layer, data will be passed through the session layer.
