**Worst Case Scenario**	O (n log n)
- We have to split n elements 

**Best Case Scneraio** Î© (n log n)
- The array is already perfectly sorted. But we still have to split and recombine it back together with this algorithm.

 The basic idea behind merge sort is it tends to be a lot easier  to sort two smaller sorted lists rather than sorting a single large, unsorted one.

#### [[Algorithm Design Paradigm]]
**Divide and Conquer**
1. **Divide** and break up the problem into the smallest possible "subproblem", of the exact same type.
2. **Conquer** and tackle the smallest subproblems first. Once you're figured out a solution that works, use that exact same technique to solve the larger subproblems - in other words, solve the subproblems recursively.
3. **Combine** the answers and build up the smaller subproblems until you finally end up applying the same solution to the larger, more complicated problem that you started off with!

#### My own Algorithm
1. Define arr = {any numbers here}
2. Define the indexes:
	1. l = for the far left index, (starts with 0)
	2. r = for the far right index
3.
