`Signed Data Type` can accept negative numbers. It however accepts lower POSITIVE values compared to the same data type but `unsigned`.
---> 8-bit signed integer accepts `-128 to 127`


`Unsigned Data Type` ONLY accepts zero or positive numbers.
---> 8-bit **un**signed integer only accepts `0 to 255`
