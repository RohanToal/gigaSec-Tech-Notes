[[Quantum computers]] affect the future of encryption

Once quantom computers exists
- RSA and Elliptical Curve Cryptography will be VERY FAST TO BREAK
Because quantum computers can very efficiently solve the mathematical problems that these algorithms rely on for their strength.

For instance, most encryption scheme relies on the fact that finding the factors of large numbers is impossible in classical computers. The quantum computr however can handle the shor's algorithm.
