The ping command is used 
- to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible


This remote resource usually be a website, but could also be for a computer on your home network if you want to check if it's configured correctly.


Ping works using the [[ICMP protocol]]


The basic syntax for ping isÂ `ping <target>` like `ping google.com`

This is a handy secondary application for ping, as it can be used to determine the IP address of the server hosting a website
