There would have to be something listening on the port they were attempting to use that was capable of receiving a "file". Which is one reason you should know whats running on your machine and shut down anything that isn't essential.

## An IP address isn't magical. 
Its just an address. 
Can I put something in your house simply by knowing your address? Of course not. Something or someone has to let it in. Same thing here.
