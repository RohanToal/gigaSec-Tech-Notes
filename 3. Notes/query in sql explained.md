A query is just a statement which 
-> declares WHAT DATA we are looking for, 
-> declares WHERE TO FIND DATA in the database, 
-> optionally, HOW TO TRANSFORM DATA before it is returned. 
It has a specific syntax though

It's basically the instructions we give to the thing but we communicate through SQL languange
