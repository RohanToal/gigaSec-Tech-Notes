By [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) count, 
it had a [10.0 CVSSv3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) score. That’s on a 0.1 to 10 scale.

But, hey, it was patched months ago. True, there was a [security hiccup with the first Log4j patch](https://thenewstack.io/another-day-another-log4j-vulnerability/), but it was quickly fixed. 


## So, we’re all good now, right? Right!?
**!! WRONG !!**.
Hackers, including state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors are [still exploiting CVE-2021-44228](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-174a)  (Log4Shell) in [VMware Horizon](https://www.vmware.com/products/horizon.html) and [Unified Access Gateway (UAG)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Unified-Access-Gateway/index.html).

“Since January 2022, [VMware NSX Network Detection and Response](https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx-network-detection-response.html) has tracked over 25 million exploit attempts against Log4j.”
