TLDR: Its really flipping complicated, and 16 weeks at a boot camp isn't going to teach you squat.

Programming is not about learning syntax and commonly used libraries. That's the easy part. It's knowing what to use and when… to solve a particular problem. It's problem solving. It's having someone say “"I have Problem X”, and being able to make the best decisions possible on how to solve that problem.

It gets complicated because Problem X may break down into 100 smaller problems, and each of those 100 problems may have 100 possible solutions. That's where it takes years and years of experience. There is often only one or a couple best solutions, and a lot goes into finding that perfect solution, such as:

-   High performance (speed!)
-   Ease of use
-   Easily maintainable
-   Easy to read (Aka not sphagetti code)
-   Minimal complexity
-   Minimal time to create
-   Follows known best practices
-   Can be reusable
-   Isnt going to become, or isn't already legacy
-   Is testable
-   Uses as few 3rd party libraries as practically possible (or at least ones everybody knows)
-   Doesnt repeat itself
-   Is secure

And many more, depending on the complexity of the problem. And that's just at the actual programming level. It doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the management, financial, marketing, and beurocratic decisions that can influence a problem.

Unfortunately, most programmers have no idea what they're doing, and it's easy to fool the non-technical people who are often making the decisions. When I hire a programmer, I'm not looking for the person who knows the most buzz words, I'm looking for the person who is the most inquisitive and passionate. They know an important skill that few have: how to look deeper. It takes a certain kind of mind.
