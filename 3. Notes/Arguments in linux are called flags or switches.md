Arguments of a command are identified by **`-` and a certain keyword known as ==flags or switches==.** 


Examples such as:
**Shows all list of folders ==(includes hidden folders)==**
- `ls --all`, the `--all` here is the **flag**


?? How to see the flags of a command?
- `man <command>`
- `<command> help`
