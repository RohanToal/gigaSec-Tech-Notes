How am I supposed to know every replacement when I go back to a piece of code 5 years later if everything is different now?

In Java a lot of stuff gives a compile error when it is deprecated. 
After a few versions, the feature is removed, then you have to know how to change it
Deprecated features are not so many in a language, if you use it regularly, you will know what has changed. 
**That is one of the quirks of using libraries, they evolve and improve.**
