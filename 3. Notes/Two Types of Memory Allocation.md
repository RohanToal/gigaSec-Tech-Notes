### [[Static Memory Allocation]]
- The memory allocated is fixed 
- Fixed Size meaning can't be increased/decreased during run time. 
- It uses the stack space

Problems with Static Memory Allocation
- If user entered **LESS than the fixed size, ==then there's a waste of memory**==
- If user entered **MORE than the fixed size, ==program will crash==**


### [[Dynamic memory allocation]] 
- Flexible memory size
- assigns the memory in heap space during the execution or run time. 
- Pointers play a very imporant role in Dynamic memory Allocation as allocated memory can only be accessed through pointers.

?? When to use Dynamic Memory Allocation
- We're not sure how much data we're gonna use during runtime
