Burp Suite is a framework written in Java  
- aims to provide one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing.
- tool for hands-on web app security assessments.
- Frequently used when attacking web and mobile apps.

Assessing mobile applications, as the same features which make it so attractive for web app testing translate almost perfectly into testing the APIs (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces) powering most mobile apps.

[[What is Burp Proxy]]

Burp can 
- capture and manipulate all of the traffic 
- between an attacker and a webserver: 

After capturing requests, 
we can choose to send them to various other parts of the Burp Suite framework

This ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests prior to them being sent to the target server (or, in some cases, the responses before they are received by our browser), makes Burp Suite perfect for any kind of manual web app testing.
