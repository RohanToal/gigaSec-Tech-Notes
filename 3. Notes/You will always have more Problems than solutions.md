# You will always have more Problems than Engineers.

Most problems are not big problems
Stuff like
-> "What should I name this variable?"
-> "Should this be a list or map?"


Software engineers rarely get
-> Training in Prioritization skills
-> Coaching in workload management
-> No great feedback loop that determines if their choices are improving




When you're overwhelmed with problems
-> Ordering them isn't the most important skill
-> Instead, filtering them is
"No, I'm not going to solve that problem right now"
Knowing what problems are valuable
Knowing what problems to say "no" to



Software Engineer in a nutshell
Team solves problems, company succeeds and grows
Now it has more, harder problems (as well as maintaining stuff already built)


Since there are always problems
Engineer's sense of accomplishment needs to come from elsewhere.

Some are lucky, they love solving problems. 
-> As long as it stays fun (usually striking the balance of difficulty/variety), 
-> Doesn't matter how many problems there are 
-> Journey is enough for them.


Others have it harder
-> To them, problems are a sign of failure
-> Beliefs like "if they worked hard/planned enough, then problems wouldn't exist"


Overall, the better way to measure progress 
-> is to ignore problems, think about what we've built
-> What things are easier now? Is it because of what we've built before?
-> What would have been fallen if we didn't do it before?
