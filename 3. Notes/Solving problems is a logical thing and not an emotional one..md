Even when you collect all details, plan, and chunk the problem 
Sometimes you cannot reach a solution. 
If you feel you are getting frustrated it is best to back up, calm down and re-state the problem. 


Getting frustrated will make you tend to 
-> complicate things, 
-> fail a solution 
-> or pick a complex solution for the problem.
