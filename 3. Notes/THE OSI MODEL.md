Abstract:

The OSI (**O**pen **S**ystems **I**nterconnection) Model is a standardised model which we **use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking**. In practice, **it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off**


The OSI Model has seven layers
7. Application
6. Presentation
5. Session
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link
1.  Physical
