The OSI (**O**pen **S**ystems **I**nterconnection) Model is a standardised model which we **use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking**. In practice, **it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off**


The OSI Model has seven layers
7. Application
6. Presentation
5. Session
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link
1.  Physical 


### [[7- Application Layer]] 
- Gives networking options to programs running on a computer

### [[6 - Presentation Layer]]
- Translates data received from application layer to standardised format 
- Handles encryption, compression etc..

### [[5 - Session Layer]]
- Set-ups a connection between other computer across network

### [[4 - Transport Layer]]
- Chooses the protocol on how data will be delievered

### [[3 - Network Layer]]
- Locates the destination of your request

### [[2 - Data Link Layer]]
- Receives packet from network layer and adds in MAC Address at endpoint

### [[1 - Physical Layer]]
- Converst electrical pulses into binary data and vice versa
