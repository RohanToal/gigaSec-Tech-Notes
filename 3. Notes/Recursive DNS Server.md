`1.1`   This server has a local cache of recently looked up domain names. If a result is found locally, this is sent back to your computer, and your request ends here. Usually provided by ISP



Else If address wasn't found in local cache, a journey begins to find the correct answer, starting with the [[internet's root DNS servers]].
