Abstract:

## What does ports do?
- These are used to point traffic to the right application on a server




## Ports are necessary for 
- making multiple network requests
- or having multiple services available. 


-> Loading several webpages at once in a web browser, 
The program must have a way of determining which tab is loading which web page. It's done by making connections to remote webservers using different ports on your local machine.

-> Server be able to run more than one service 
(like using HTTP and HTTPS versions of the site), 
Then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the solution to this. 



## Network connections are made between TWO ports 
- an open port listening on the server  
- and a randomly selected port on your own computer. 


For instance, 
`tryhackme.com` server's port is 443 
Connecting to your `computer's` open port at 62534
