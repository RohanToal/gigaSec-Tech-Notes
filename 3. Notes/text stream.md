### Text Streams
Text input/output is dealt with as text streams or streams of characters. 
    A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; 
    Each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character.
    Like this
    `123123123\n`   <- 1st Text stream  
    `dflgkjdlfg\n` <- 2nd Text Stream
    `\n`                      <- 3rd Text Stream
