URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
It's an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet.  These are all the features of a url. Note that it doesn't need to use all of them for the url to work

Myquestion: ?? What does "resource" exactly mean here ?? 


Parts of a URL
[[Scheme]] --- [[Host-Domain]] --- [[Path]] --- [[Fragment]]

[[User]] --- [[Port]] --- [[Query String]]
