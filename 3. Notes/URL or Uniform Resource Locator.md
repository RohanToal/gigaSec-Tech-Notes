URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
It's an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet.  

Myquestion: ?? What does "resource" exactly mean here ?? 
Answer: Probably the websites files like html, images, pdf etc..

These are all the features of a url. Note that it doesn't need to use all of them for the url to work
[[Scheme]] --- [[Host-Domain]] --- [[Path]] --- [[Fragment]]

[[User]] --- [[Port]] --- [[Query String]]



[[Communication between webserver and the client-user]]
To access a website, you give a [[request]] to the webserver and the webserver will give a [[response]] to you, if the reply is Ok, the files that's required to display the website will be sent to your computer.
