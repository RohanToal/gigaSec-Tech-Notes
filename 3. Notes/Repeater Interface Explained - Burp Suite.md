1. At the very top left of the tab, 
    List of Repeater requests. 
    New request to Repeater will appear up here.
    We can have many different requests going through Repeater 

2. Directly underneath the request list, 
    We have the controls for the current request. These allow us to send a request, cancel a hanging request, and go forwards/backwards in the request history.
