1. At the very top left of the tab, 
    List of Repeater requests. 
    New request to Repeater will appear up here.
    Different requests going through Repeater is possible 

2. Directly underneath the request list, 
    Controls for current request. 
    Allow us to `send` request, `cancel` a hanging request, 
    or go forwards/backwards in the request history.

3. Still on the left-hand side of the tab, taking up the most window
    We EDIT request in the Request view then press SEND. 
    The RESPONSE will show up in the Response view.

4. Above the request/response section, on the right-hand side, 
    allows to change layout

5. At the right-hand side of the window, we have the Inspector, 
    break requests apart to analyse and edit them 
    in a slightly more intuitive way than with the raw editor.

6. Finally, above the Inspector we have our target. 
    IP address or domain to which we are sending requests. 
    Will be filled in automatically when we send requests to Repeater from other parts of Burp Suite.
