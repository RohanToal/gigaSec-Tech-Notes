This is where I put every details of the note

Note: As you navigate my system, you might see some slip-ups but the design of this sytem is meant to be flexible and doesn't demand strict categorization, labeling or note-scheduling thus it doesn't affect my workflow. Thus some notes will not follow the same structure of this, but I rarely do it.
