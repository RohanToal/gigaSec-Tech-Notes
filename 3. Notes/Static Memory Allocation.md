The memory allocated is fixed, meaning can't be increased/decreased during run time. 
- It uses the stack space


Problems with Static Memory Allocation
- If user entered **LESS than the fixed size, ==then there's a waste of memory**==
- If user entered **MORE than the fixed size, ==program will crash
