Notes may contain grammatical errors and some wont make sense and will only make sense to me. Understand that I wrote this notes for me and to be understood by me. However, I highly encourage collaboration such as grammer corrections or correcting misinformation.

## Installation

I recommended installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor. Otherwise, you can use any markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature. 

**Obsidian Installation**

There are only three plugins installed here and only used for theme customization

1. [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)
2. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)
3. [Advance Table Editing](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)

... Still working this part here
Click `Turn Off Safe Mode`

## Quick Guide of navigating my notes

My system of note taking is a combination of the principles I learned in [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/) and [MOC](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6). As you navigate my system, you might see some slip-ups but I designed it to be flexible and doesn't demand strict categorization, labeling or note-scheduling thus it doesn't affect my workflow. 

However, you don't need to learn those said principles. You just need to click the `hyperlinks` and you're good to navigate my notes.

My notes takes three stages of writing and I use tags to assign these. Specifically these tags are `#fleeting` `#literature` and `#permanent`.

**Explanations of each tags**

`#fleeting`
- Basically these are drafts. Snippets from an article/video that I think are interesting.
- Some of it are unfinished or notes that are still waiting to be reviewed.


`#literature`
- Polished version of #fleeting where I organize, remove or highlight words. 


`#permanent`
- Contains only one concise piece of knowledge that are most translated by my own words. 
- It's not only summarization but rather a technique called "[Atomizing Notes](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic#:~:text=Zettelkasten%20notes%20are%20atomic%20and,idea%20and%20one%20idea%20only.)"

## Quick guide about using my Obsidian Vault

1. My vault matches with the theme of the system. 

- If windows is on dark mode, obsidian will be on dark mode
- If windows is light mode, obsidian will be in light mode

2. You can manually switch to dark mode or light mode

- `Ctrl + Shift + D` to Dark mode
- `Ctrl + Shift + L` to Light mode
- Or simply press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type `Dark Mode` or `Light Mode`  


3. All Deleted Files goes to .trash folder which is hidden
