## Installation Process to be able to use my notes

I recommended installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor. Otherwise, you can use any markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature. 

**Obsidian Installation**

1.  Download this repository

2.  Install the app -> https://obsidian.md and launch the app

3. Click "Open Folder as vault" and choose the downloaded folder of this repo 

4. You will be presented with a choice 
- Keep Safe Mode on

---> Turns off every plugins I installed

---> All plugins and customizations are stored in the `.obsidian` hidden folder

- Turn off Safe Mode

---> Basically a full replica of my vault. 

---> It keeps all my customizations and installed plugins enabled 


There are only three plugins installed in my vault and only used for customization

1. [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)

2. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

3. [Advance Table Editing](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)

## Quick Guide of navigating my notes

As you navigate my system, you might see some slip-ups but I designed my system to be flexible and doesn't demand strict categorization, labeling or note-scheduling thus it doesn't affect my workflow. 

However, you don't need to learn those said principles. You just need to click the `hyperlinks` and you're good to navigate my notes. Starting from `3. Notes/+Home`

My notes takes three stages of writing and I use tags to assign these. Specifically these tags are `#fleeting` `#literature` and `#permanent`.

**Explanations of each tags**

`#fleeting`
- Basically these are drafts. Snippets from an article/video that I think are interesting.
- Some of it are unfinished or notes that are still waiting to be reviewed.


`#literature`
- Polished version of #fleeting where I organize, remove or highlight words. 


`#permanent`
- Contains only one concise piece of knowledge that are most translated by my own words. 
- It's not only summarization but rather a technique called "[Atomizing Notes](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic#:~:text=Zettelkasten%20notes%20are%20atomic%20and,idea%20and%20one%20idea%20only.)"

## Quick guide about using my Obsidian Vault

1. My vault matches with the theme of the system. 

- If windows is on dark mode, obsidian will be on dark mode
- If windows is light mode, obsidian will be in light mode

2. You can manually switch to dark mode or light mode

- `Ctrl + Shift + D` to Dark mode
- `Ctrl + Shift + L` to Light mode
- Or simply press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type `Dark Mode` or `Light Mode`  


3. All Deleted Files goes to .trash folder which is hidden
