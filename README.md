## Installation Process to be able to use my notes

I recommend installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor. Otherwise, you can use any markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature. 

### 3 Step Process of Installing Obsidian

1-> Download this repository and Install the app -> https://obsidian.md

2-> Launch the app and Click "Open Folder as vault". Choose the downloaded folder of this repo 

3-> After doing the step above. You will be presented with two choices  
- _Keep Safe Mode on_
- _Turn Off Sade Mode_

??-> **Keep Safe Mode on**

---> Turns off every plugins I installed

---> All plugins and customizations are stored in the `.obsidian` hidden folder

??-> **Turn off Safe Mode**

---> Basically a full replica of my vault. 

---> It keeps all my customizations and installed plugins enabled 


There are only three plugins installed in my vault and only used for customization

1. [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)

2. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

3. [Advance Table Editing](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)


That's it. You're good to navigate my notes now

## Quick Guide of navigating my notes

**What is a `hyperlink`?**

^--> Imagine a search engine, those underlined words will take you to the right website. That's basically what hyperlink is, it takes you to the right note assigned to it.  

**Go to the home file first -> `3. Notes/+Home`**

^--> Just click the `hyperlinks` to your chosen content. 

**Each note has a `hyperlink` at the top** except for `+Home` file

^--> Purpose is to take you back to the parent note that it came from.

**Obsidian has a search feature.**

^--> Click `Ctrl + Shift + F` and you can search the files there. 

**Got Lost**?

^--> Always come back to your home file `3. Notes/+Home`.
