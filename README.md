# Summary
To fully take advantage of my notes. **Use a markdown editor that supports hyperlink** like [obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

**Notes aren't CATEGORIZED into folders** by complete intention and design. **Categorization of each topics** is possible by the file **`3. Notes/+Home.md`**

Uses principles in [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/), [MOC](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6), and [How I Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502)

## Installation Process to be able to use my notes

I recommend installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor. Otherwise, you can use any markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature. 

### Steps of Obsidian Installation

-> Download this repository and Install the app -> https://obsidian.md

-> Launch the app and Click "Open Folder as vault". Choose the downloaded folder of this repo 

-> After doing the step above. You will be presented with two choices  
- _Keep Safe Mode on_
- _Turn Off Sade Mode_

??-> **Keep Safe Mode on**

---> Turns off every plugins I installed

---> All plugins and customizations are stored in the `.obsidian` hidden folder

??-> **Turn off Safe Mode**

---> Basically a full replica of my vault. 

---> It keeps all my customizations and installed plugins enabled 


There are only three plugins installed in my vault and only used for customization

1. [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)

2. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

3. [Advance Table Editing](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)


That's it. You're good to navigate my notes now

## Quick Guide of navigating my notes

**What is a `hyperlink`?**

^--> Imagine a search engine, those underlined words will take you to the right website. That's basically what hyperlink is, it takes you to the right note assigned to it.  

**Go to the home file first -> `3. Notes/+Home`**

^--> Just click the `hyperlinks` to your chosen content. 

**Each note has a `hyperlink` at the top** except for `+Home` file

^--> Purpose is to take you back to the parent note that it came from.

**Obsidian has a search feature.**

^--> Click `Ctrl + Shift + F` and you can search the files there. 

**Got Lost**?

^--> Always come back to your home file `3. Notes/+Home`.


### More info on how I take my notes, otherwise you can skip this read.

I knew I had to find the right note-taking system. I had a problem where I spent most of my time googling the same stuffs over and over again. Storing it in a bookmark was a pain at all as categorizing it turned into a job. I also realized that everything in technology seems to be connected to each other. If I learned a hacking technique that uses python languange and the technique also applies to networking, then where do I put my notes? Is it in hacking folder, python folder or networking folder? That's where I realized that traditional note taking method will not do me any favor.

Here, I devoted my time on learning how to take notes effectively in which I did so by exploring [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/), [MOC](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6), and [How I Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502).   


As you navigate my system, you might see some slip-ups but the design of this sytem is meant to be flexible and doesn't demand strict categorization, labeling or note-scheduling thus it doesn't affect my workflow. 


My notes takes three stages of writing and I use tags to assign these. Specifically these tags are `#fleeting` `#literature` and `#permanent`.

**Explanations of each tags**

`#fleeting`
- Basically these are drafts. Snippets from an article/video that I think are interesting.
- Some of it are unfinished or notes that are still waiting to be reviewed.


`#literature`
- Polished version of #fleeting where I organize, remove or highlight words. 


`#permanent`
- Contains only one concise piece of knowledge that are most translated by my own words. 
- It's not only summarization but rather a technique called "[Atomizing Notes](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic#:~:text=Zettelkasten%20notes%20are%20atomic%20and,idea%20and%20one%20idea%20only.)"

With this, it seems like a long hectic note taking method but here is where [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/) comes into play. Basically the whole idea of it is to only modify each note by chance. Meaning if you haven't touched the note for so long, then you don't need to do anything at all. It can be safely ignored no matter if the status of note is `#fleeting`. Doesn't matter, the note will stay intact with your system.
