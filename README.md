## Quick Guide of navigating my notes

My system of note taking is a combination of the principles I learned in [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/) and [MOC](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6). As you navigate my system, you might see some slip-ups but it is designed to be flexible and doesn't demand strict categorization, labeling or note-scheduling thus it doesn't affect my workflow. 

My notes takes three stages of writing and I use tags to assign these. Specifically these tags are `#fleeting` `#literature` and `#permanent`.

**Explanations of each tags**

`#fleeting`
- Basically these are drafts. Snippets from an article/video that I think are interesting.
- Some of it are unfinished or notes that are still waiting to be reviewed.


`#literature`
- Polished version of #fleeting where I organize, remove or highlight words. 


`#permanent`
- Contains only one concise piece of knowledge that are most translated by my own words. 
- It's not only summarization but rather a technique called "[Atomizing Notes](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic#:~:text=Zettelkasten%20notes%20are%20atomic%20and,idea%20and%20one%20idea%20only.)"

## Installation

I recommended installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor. Otherwise, you can use any markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature. 

**Obsidian Installation**

`.obsidian` is where Obsidian themes, settings and plugins are stored. It can be skipped and will perfectly work fine without it even if you use obsidian. 

If you included `.obsidian` follow these, otherwise these step can be ignored.

There are only two plugins installed here and only used for theme customization

1. [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)
2. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

Click `Turn Off Safe Mode`
