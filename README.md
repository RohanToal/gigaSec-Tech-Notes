**Purpose:**

This is an attempt to make my notes public and to document everything I've learned. 


**Installation**

Use a markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature. I recommended installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor.

**Guide when navigating my notes**

My notes takes three stages of writing and I use tags to assign these. Specifically these tags are `#fleeting` `#literature` and `#permanent`. My system of note taking is a combination of the principles I learned in [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/) and [MOC](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6). 


**Explanations of each tags**
#fleeting
- Basically these are drafts. Snippets from an article/video that I think are interesting.
- Some of it are unfinished or notes that's still are waiting to be reviewed.


#literature
- Polished version of #fleeting where I organize, remove or highlight words. 


#permanent
- Contains only one concise piece of knowledge that are most translated by my own words. 
- It's not only summarization but rather a technique called "[Atomizing Notes](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic#:~:text=Zettelkasten%20notes%20are%20atomic%20and,idea%20and%20one%20idea%20only.)"
