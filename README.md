## Installation Process to be able to use my notes

I recommend installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor. Otherwise, you can use any markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature. 

### 3 Step Process of Installing Obsidian

1-> Download this repository and Install the app -> https://obsidian.md

2-> Launch the app and Click "Open Folder as vault". Choose the downloaded folder of this repo 

3-> After doing the step above. You will be presented with two choices  


There are only three plugins installed in my vault and only used for customization

1. [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)

2. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

3. [Advance Table Editing](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)
